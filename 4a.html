<h4>
 Specialization
</h4>
<p>
 Each fall, the various academic fields bear a new crop of
… subfields. I remember premed students at my undergrad enumerating the pros
and cons of a doing a degree in
 <em>
  human
 </em>
 biology
as opposed to just biology. My sister studied biogeochemistry, which is what you
get when you take ecology and add math. When it comes to academic research,
precise scholarly units like these make confident conclusions about the
phenomena they study. But the same narrowness that grants them certainty also helps
them dodge the big, tough questions that exist prior to academic
departments&#8212;the very questions we depend on scholars to answer.
</p>
<p>
 Let’s focus on the discipline of history, which
has been fragmented by specialization and is now having second thoughts.
Compared to about fifty years ago, today’s research historians work with
narrower date ranges, smaller geographic regions, and tighter demographic foci.
This trend, called microhistory, answers to a statistical suspicion about grand
narratives. Unlike historians in Marxist, feminist, and other ideological
traditions, who sought patterns in the historical record, microhistorians argue
that history is a Brownian process: technically determinist, but far too
complex to assess meaningfully. Thus, we need to zoom in. A typical
microhistory might examine the impact of a given subsidy on a local farming
community or a neighborhood church’s liturgical practices before and after a regime
change. For microhistorians, the unit of research ought to be small enough to
discern individual collisions among people, actions, and places, lest we get
distracted by random patterns in the noise.
</p>
<p>
 Recently, macrohistory (with an <em>a</em>) has staged a comeback. A new
generation of academics has come to question microhistory’s political
agnosticism, and the average dissertation’s timespan is widening again. Moreover,
thanks to new technologies and data-processing techniques, historians are
learning to make their work more relevant. History departments have surrendered
their loyalty to the tightly-reasoned 80,000-word thesis and are asking their
PhD students to code websites, produce documentaries, and compile digital
archives. The recrudescence of the long term earns a warm welcome from historians
Jo Guldi and David Armitage, who argue that the problem with microhistory is
that parochial histories of moments and places fail to answer meaningful historical
questions.<a href="#ftn4" id="ftnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
 Asked why things turn out the way they do, microhistory
can only throw its hands in the air and say, “It’s a snarl of conflicting
forces.” Forget Howard Zinn: Alex Jones will gladly bring a machete down on
this Gordian knot. His narratives, if bullshit, at least satisfy our desire for
explanations.
</p>
<p>
 The work of history is to fish whys and hows
from the ocean of facts. When historians shy away from this task, they hand
their audience over to malevolent actors who will entertain them with facile,
seductive arguments about how history “really” plays out. The same can be said
of increasing specialization in other academic fields.
</p>
<p>
 Talented researchers who chase narrow
certainties leave it to ignorant pundits to answer the big questions. How can
we ensure that smart people receive some airtime, too? One group of academics
argues that the title of PhD confers a responsibility to educate the public.
