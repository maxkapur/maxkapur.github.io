# Favicon development area

`favicon.svg` is the source file from which the rasterized variants in
`assets/favicon/` are generated. I used the following website to generate the
rasterized variants:

<https://simplefavicons.netlify.app/>

That site also provides code to put into the HTML head element and the PWA
`site.manifest` file to ensure that favicons render correctly.
