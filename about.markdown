I’m a master’s student in the department of industrial engineering at Seoul National University, where my research concerns numerical modeling of college admissions markets. I also work as a research assistant in the [Management Science/Optimization Lab](https://polytope.snu.ac.kr/) at SNU, where I assist with a variety of projects related to linear and nonlinear programming, combinatorial optimization, and simulation.

Prior to my studies at SNU, I taught English for two years as a US State Department Fulbright scholar at a middle school in Naju, South Korea. I graduated from the University of Southern California in 2018 with degress in jazz piano and Korean in 2018; here’s my [senior recital video](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL06yMQdXWrp9VsynaPe2mg2gjHfr45VZO).

I care a lot about free software, open science, and the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/). In my free time, I also make music, teach, and write about education.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/maxkapur), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxkapur/), [Julia Discourse](https://discourse.julialang.org/u/maxkapur/), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRfryFgD6JkqJiTA_MTkHXw), and [Bandcamp](http://max-kapur.bandcamp.com/).
