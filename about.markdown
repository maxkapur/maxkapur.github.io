I am an operations research analyst at the consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton,
where I use modeling, simulation, numerical optimization, and algorithmic game
theory to solve client problems in a variety of sectors.

In 2022, I completed my master&rsquo;s degree in industrial engineering at Seoul
National University, where my
[thesis research](https://github.com/maxkapur/CollegeApplication) concerned
numerical modeling of college admissions markets. I also worked as a research
assistant in the [Management Science/Optimization Lab](https://polytope.snu.ac.kr/)
at SNU, where I supported a variety of projects related to linear and nonlinear
programming, combinatorial optimization, and urban transit network models.

Prior to my studies at SNU, I taught English for two years as a US State
Department Fulbright scholar at a middle school in Naju, South Korea.
I graduated from the University of Southern California in 2018 with degrees in
jazz piano and Korean in 2018; hereâ€™s my

Fulbright or Critical Language scholarships, the Government of Korea Scholarship,
