I am an operations research analyst and senior consultant at Booz Allen Hamilton, where I use modeling, simulation, and numerical optimization to solve challenging, urgent problems in the energy and defense sectors.

I recently completed my master’s degree industrial engineering at Seoul National University, where my research concerned numerical modeling of college admissions markets. I also worked as a research assistant in the [Management Science/Optimization Lab](https://polytope.snu.ac.kr/) at SNU, where I supported a variety of projects related to linear and nonlinear programming, combinatorial optimization, and urban transit network simulation.

Prior to my studies at SNU, I taught English for two years as a US State Department Fulbright scholar at a middle school in Naju, South Korea. I graduated from the University of Southern California in 2018 with degress in jazz piano and Korean in 2018; here’s my [senior recital video](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL06yMQdXWrp9VsynaPe2mg2gjHfr45VZO).

I care a lot about free software, open science, and the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/). In my free time, I also make music, teach, and write about education.

Feel free to contact me with questions about the US State Department's Fulbright or Critical Language scholarships, the Government of Korea Scholarship, or anything else on my profile. You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/maxkapur), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxkapur/), [Julia Discourse](https://discourse.julialang.org/u/maxkapur/), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRfryFgD6JkqJiTA_MTkHXw), and [Bandcamp](http://max-kapur.bandcamp.com/).
