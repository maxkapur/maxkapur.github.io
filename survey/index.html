<h1>Using Data to Understand ELL Students</h1>
    
<p>Rather than write a traditional abstract, <strong>I&rsquo;ll just highlight the most important bits like this</strong>, for those of you who are as tired as I am of staring at a screen all day.</p>

<h2>Survey Design</h2>
    
<h2>Survey Results</h2>

<p>The most obvious thing to do, once we have all the data in a spreadsheet, is start taking averages and see what stands out. There&rsquo;s a problem with just looking at averages, though: they tell us nothing about how the data is actually <em>distributed.</em> Compare these scenarios:</p>
    <ul><li>Nearly every student answers with <code>agree (4)</code></li>
    <li>One third of the students answer with <code>neutral (3)</code>, another third answers <code>agree (4)</code>, and the final third chooses <code>strongly agree (5)</code>.</li></ul>
    
<p>In both cases the average is <code>4</code>, but in the third case, the data aren&rsquo;t as consistent. To quantify this uncertainty, I computed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test#One-sample_t-test">one-sample <em>t</em>-scores</a> for each question&rsquo;s average. The further the <em>t</em>-score gets from zero, the more confidently we can say that the &ldquo;true&rdquo; average (the average if you could interview an infinite number of students like mine) is <em>not</em> <code>3</code>. A negative <em>t</em>-score means the true answer is likely lower than <code>3</code>; positive, higher.</p>
    
<p>Take a look:</p>

    <p class="caption">Here I&rsquo;ve done something unusual in plotting the <em>t</em>-scores directly, instead of averages with error bars. This is because there are risks inherent in interpreting error bars when you compute them for several samples, as I&rsquo;ve done here. Better to just plot the <em>t</em>-scores and see what stands out. Thanks to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57601156/change-axis-along-which-seaborn-applies-color-palette">people on Stack Overflow</a> for helping me get the color map working.</p>

<p><strong>More videos and more games</strong>&mdash;I saw that coming. Knowing the sometimes-militant style of my colleagues, I also expected the students to tell me I wasn't being strict enough. I didn't expect to hear that <strong>both I <em>and</em> the other teachers should be stricter</strong> (which is what the negative responses to "If the teachers at our school were less strict, I would learn more" mean, once you puzzle out the conditional).</p>

<p>Before we get into the other stuff, I'd like to break down these results by class, since the differences were pretty interesting:</p>
    
    <a href="classT.png"><img src="classT.png" /></a>
    <p class="caption">These are <em>t</em>-scores again. There are two class sections in each grade, so six columns.</p>
    
<p>Let me tell you about class 3-2. They might be my favorite class. They're slightly noisy and often tardy, but they tend to get into a nice rhythm if I supply them with a sufficiently interesting activity, and I never have trouble getting volunteers to speak. Moreover, they had the highest average scores on our speaking test last semester. That's why <strong>I was surprised to see 3-2 agree so uniformly with</strong> <code>English is one of my most challenging subjects</code>.</p>

<p>Another interesting row is <code>If the teachers at our school were less strict, I would learn more</code>. Here the very prominent differences between the classes was obscure when I averaged them together. Broken up like this, and knowing who the homeroom teacher is for each class, I can see that <strong>students' assessments of the prototypical "teacher at our school" is informed heavily by who <em>their</em> homeroom teacher is</strong>.</p>
    
<p>OK, are you ready for my favorite graph? I posted this in the group chat with my Fulbright colleagues and got crickets. It's alright.</p>

<h2>Application</h2>
<p>So, I can't just do what the students tell me to. At the very least, I'll need my vice principal's permission before I screen movies every day! (He might even say yes. There is an elective class in film appreciation at our school.)</p>
<p>At the same time, it was important to me that the students knew that I had actually gone through the surveys, so the week after I collected them, I showed them these graphs and explained the most salient features. I also did a "write-ins that made me laugh" slide where I showcased some of the funny answers to <code>Is there anything else you'd like Max to know?</code> There were some real gems:</p>
    <ul><li>"Change your fashion."</li>
    <li>"Yes."</li>
    <li>(A detailed comparative analysis of various pizza and fried-chicken restaurants in the area)</li>
    <li>"EEEEEE~"</li>
    <li>"We are crazy men."</li></ul>
<p>After sharing these responses, I distilled the above graphs into a few general takeaways. I explained that we'd still have to wait until the end of the semester to watch a full-length movie, but we can do more TED talks and music videos in regular class. I also had them brainstorm ideas for speaking practice that don't involve presentations and partner activities.</p>
<p>The greatest benefit of this analysis, however, has been to my lesson planning. I tend to plan my lessons with clusters <code>0</code> (the try-hards) and <code>1</code> (the disinterested) in mind, which means I evaluate each activity on the challenging/interesting spectrum and try to have a balance. But this approach neglects the largest group of students, cluster <code>2</code>, who expressed both interest <em>and</em> challenge in English, defying my assumption that the students who thought English was important would then study it the hardest and find it the least difficult.</p>
