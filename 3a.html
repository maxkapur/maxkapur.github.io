<h4>
 Media Literacy
</h4>
<p>
 When you scroll through your news feed or burrow into a YouTube
rabbit hole, you do more than consume digital entertainment; you also supply
valuable information to those platforms’ recommendation algorithms, which study
your swipes and prepare the most addictive medley of ads and content to hold your
attention. We’ve heard a lot about the intrinsic flaws of the attention marketplace&#8212;how
the algorithms it produces tend to guide consumers toward clickbaity political
extremes and away from good-faith debate. But unplugging students from social
media is a nonviable solution, because social media is now an essential part of
kids’ existence. Without it, they have few options for learning about school
events, talking about personal issues with their friends, or keeping up with
political debates.
</p>
<p>
 The goal of media literacy (sometimes called
digital literacy or information literacy) is for students to keep their
intellectual guard up as they navigate digital space. In one common media-literacy
activity, students pull examples of media from their own social-networking
sites. For each source, they make a table assessing the text’s tone, its
intended audience, the source’s bias and conflicts of interests, and the
credibility and variety of its citations. Then they deliver a trust-or-bust
verdict. This process is meant to show that media comes with motives, that
shouldn’t take every claim we encounter at face value.
</p>
<p>
 In the exercise above, media literacy is a counteralgorithm,
a series of dispassionate filters you apply to a given piece of media to
determine whether the author is trying to pull the wool over your monitor. But sociotechnical
researcher danah boyd points out that the media litmus tests taught in American
schools are not as politically neutral as they may seem. Often, they lead
students to prize a liberal epistemology of data-dumping and analytical
phrasing over the gritty appeals to morality and tradition that dominate
conservative media. These are issues of style and form, not content. And while it
may be the case that magical thinking is more prevalent on the political right,
current media-literacy pedagogy teaches students only to
 <em>
  make
 </em>
 this association&#8212;to feel distrustful when they recognize the
shibboleths of conservative rhetoric. It doesn’t equip them to critique a
source’s underlying argument.<a href="#ftn1" id="ftnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
 Media literacy markets itself as the solution
to political disinformation, but like any algorithm with poorly chosen
heuristics, it is hackable. Let’s say I adapt media-literacy pedagogy for my
Korean students and teach them to doubt the exaggerated claims made by MOGEF’s
opponents. I tell my students that trustworthy sources usually cite
quantitative data and explain their interpretations through careful reasoning, whereas
fraudsters tend to fly bright chyrons across the display and appeal to base
emotions.
</p>
<p>
 In
2040, the robot that writes Jun-ho’s morning news will know from its trove of
biometric data that Jun-ho, due to subconscious reflexes honed in my media-literacy
class and others like it, tends to trust news articles that feature dark grey
text on a white background and ample bar graphs. Now, if the alt-right’s fringe
candidate wants to win Jun-ho back, all his backers need to do is pay the robot
company to stuff Jun-ho’s articles full of
 <em>
  their
 </em>
 graphs, favoring
 <em>
  their
 </em>
 political beliefs,
and all written in the calm, reasonable tone Jun-ho associates with
intelligence.<a href="#ftn2" id="ftnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
 But we’re getting ahead of ourselves. Taught
well, media literacy will encompass more than superficial indices of political
orientation. In addition to recognizing the warning signs of shoddy argument,
students will know how to compare smart-sounding claims by applying universal
principles of logic. They will learn, in other words, to think
 <em>
  critically.

   Daniel Kahneman,
   <em>
    Thinking, Fast and Slow
   </em>
   (New
York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2011), chap. 9 discusses cognitive biases and
simplifying heuristics. These are psychological shortcuts that our mind uses
when making decisions and evaluating information, and they help explain why people
who ought to know better can have their judgment swayed by extraneous factors. For
example, readers tend not to trust text that is blurry or pixelated.<a href="#ftnref2">↖</a>
