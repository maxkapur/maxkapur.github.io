<h2>Korea¡¯s Version of the Alt-Right</h2>

<p class=MsoSubtitle>How do young people make political judgments?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>I asked a class of boys at a Korean middle school, ¡°What
would you do if you were president?¡± A student I¡¯ll call Jun-ho stuck his hand
in the air like he¡¯d been waiting for the moment: ¡°No more Yeoseong Gajok-bu!¡± </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The Ministry of Gender Equality and Family. It¡¯s
a government ministry responsible for, among other things, encouraging Koreans
to have babies and inspecting public toilets for hidden cameras. For the most
part, MOGEF plays it safe, advancing modest reforms with probably undue fanfare,
but like any country¡¯s gender-equality enforcement agency, it draws the ire of
social conservatives and redpillers. And middle-school boys, apparently.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>I smiled neutrally. ¡°What¡¯s wrong with them?¡±</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>¡°It¡¯s unfair!¡± Jun-ho said. He continued in
Korean: While MOGEF¡¯s mission is to enforce Korea¡¯s gender-equality statutes,
in practice, they discriminate against men. Just look at the organization¡¯s
(Korean) title: it doesn¡¯t say ¡°gender equality¡± anywhere; only ¡°women¡± and
¡°family.¡± A couple of Jun-ho¡¯s classmates nodded in agreement.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Oh no,</i>
I thought. Had my students fallen prey to fake news? Korea¡¯s version of the
alt-right maintains that progressive institutions like MOGEF are puppets of the
wealthy, built to consolidate power under the guise of trendy causes like
feminism. I could easily picture Jun-ho seeing a post about the organization on
social media, plugging ¡°MOGEF discrimination¡± into a search engine, and stumbling
on some fringe political forum thanks to his mindless choice of phrasing.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>According to the media-literacy pedagogy I¡¯d
studied, I should be guiding students away from internet conspiracies and
toward nonpartisan sources (like, well, MOGEF) if I wanted to talk about a
hot-button issue like gender equality in class. But I hadn¡¯t made any allowance
for this detour in my lesson plan. Trying to make an English lesson out of a
dicey moment, I wrote the phrases <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>gender
equality</i> and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>discrimination </i>on
the board, had the students puzzle out their meanings, and congratulated myself
for getting us back on track.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Notice how I pulled a pedagogical
bait-and-switch on my students. Jun-ho made a specific argument&#8212;MOGEF discriminates
against men&#8212;and I maneuvered the class toward the neutral ground of English
vocabulary. The implicit message, then, was that Jun-ho¡¯s research wasn¡¯t
relevant to what we do at school. But that¡¯s not what I meant. On the contrary,
the very reason I teach English formulas like ¡°What would you do?¡± is to equip
students to read about the issues that matter to them and discuss their
opinions with a global community. Given a second chance, is there a way I
could¡¯ve affirmed Jun-ho¡¯s curiosity, talking him back from the political edge
while still encouraging my students to research topics that interest them?</p>

<h2>Thesis Statement</h2>

<p class=MsoSubtitle>What is the pedagogy of narrative fluency, and where does
it fall short?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The aim of liberal-arts classes like foreign languages,
history, and social studies is to teach students how to handle information. Information
is more than just data and facts, grammar and vocab. Postmodernism tells us
that information is never far from narrative&#8212;good- and bad-faith narratives,
fictional and nonfictional narratives, and downright fake narratives. Today, the
ability to assess bias and generate compelling original arguments is no longer an
abstract exercise, but an essential survival skill. Cases like Jun-ho¡¯s,
however, remind us that pedagogical ideals like media literacy, critical
thinking, and intellectual responsibility are difficult to package in a lesson
plan. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Social-science educators, recognizing the
importance of narrative skills, have abandoned traditional practices like
memorization and translation in favor of discursive models suited to our
postmodern environment. In K&#8211;12 education, media-literacy and critical-thinking
activities aim to help students sort facts from opinions and detect bias (or
malice) in media. In higher ed, meanwhile, the conversation centers around protecting
the intellectual standing of academia and dissuading the public from phony news
sites and bad science. While these initiatives¡¯ immediate goals vary, all
invest in what I call narrative fluency: the ability to dissemble narratives
into claims of fact and assemble facts into compelling narratives.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The pedagogy of narrative fluency misses the
mark in two crucial ways. First, it situates the machinery of disinformation
outside the student's mind, as though objectivity can be reached if we only
think hard enough. In fact, it's the pleasant delusion of objective witness
that makes bad-faith narratives so infectious. Second, narrative fluency
advertises itself as a moral tonic, but at best it is morally neutral, and in
practice it backfires easily. Some students who absorb the lessons of narrative
fluency will become woke journalists or grassroots politicians, but those who
are savvy enough to measure the broken incentives of the modern economy will
recognize that they can make a lot more money by turning their back on humanist
ideals and manipulating their peers for pay.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>It should therefore come as no surprise that
elite schools promise that their students are the most narratively fluent of
all. Narrative fluency, like similar pedagogical trends that went before it, is
already helping the wealthy safeguard their influence from generational change.</p>

<h2>Narrative Fluency in K&#8211;12 Education</h2>

<p class=MsoSubtitle>Can facts be protected from postmodernism?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Many schoolteachers want to restore the distinction
between facts and narratives that has been lost under postmodernism. Through projects
like the media-literacy movement and critical-thinking initiatives, K&#8211;12
educators hope to derive a consistent process for discerning fact from fiction.
Their results, however, testify to the pervasiveness of the postmodern
phenomenon by asserting that truth is not fixed, but an ideal to be pursued, an
asymptote always just out of reach.</p>

<h3>Media Literacy</h3>

<p class=MsoBodyText>When you scroll through your news feed or burrow into a YouTube
rabbit hole, you do more than consume digital entertainment; you also supply
valuable information to those platforms¡¯ recommendation algorithms, which study
your swipes and prepare the most addictive medley of ads and content to hold your
attention. We¡¯ve heard a lot about the intrinsic flaws of the attention marketplace&#8212;how
the algorithms it produces tend to guide consumers toward clickbaity political
extremes and away from good-faith debate. But unplugging students from social
media is a nonviable solution, because social media is now an essential part of
kids¡¯ existence. Without it, they have few options for learning about school
events, talking about personal issues with their friends, or keeping up with
political debates. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The goal of media literacy (sometimes called
digital literacy or information literacy) is for students to keep their
intellectual guard up as they navigate digital space. In one common media-literacy
activity, students pull examples of media from their own social-networking
sites. For each source, they make a table assessing the text¡¯s tone, its
intended audience, the source¡¯s bias and conflicts of interests, and the
credibility and variety of its citations. Then they deliver a trust-or-bust
verdict. This process is meant to show that media comes with motives, that
shouldn¡¯t take every claim we encounter at face value.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In the exercise above, media literacy is a counteralgorithm,
a series of dispassionate filters you apply to a given piece of media to
determine whether the author is trying to pull the wool over your monitor. But sociotechnical
researcher danah boyd points out that the media litmus tests taught in American
schools are not as politically neutral as they may seem. Often, they lead
students to prize a liberal epistemology of data-dumping and analytical
phrasing over the gritty appeals to morality and tradition that dominate
conservative media. These are issues of style and form, not content. And while it
may be the case that magical thinking is more prevalent on the political right,
current media-literacy pedagogy teaches students only to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>make</i> this association&#8212;to feel distrustful when they recognize the
shibboleths of conservative rhetoric. It doesn¡¯t equip them to critique a
source¡¯s underlying argument.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn1' href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:

mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
KO;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA'>[1]</span></span><![endif]></span></span></a></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Media literacy markets itself as the solution
to political disinformation, but like any algorithm with poorly chosen
heuristics, it is hackable. Let¡¯s say I adapt media-literacy pedagogy for my
Korean students and teach them to doubt the exaggerated claims made by MOGEF¡¯s
opponents. I tell my students that trustworthy sources usually cite
quantitative data and explain their interpretations through careful reasoning, whereas
fraudsters tend to fly bright chyrons across the display and appeal to base
emotions.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;</span>In
2040, the robot that writes Jun-ho¡¯s morning news will know from its trove of
biometric data that Jun-ho, due to subconscious reflexes honed in my media-literacy
class and others like it, tends to trust news articles that feature dark grey
text on a white background and ample bar graphs. Now, if the alt-right¡¯s fringe
candidate wants to win Jun-ho back, all his backers need to do is pay the robot
company to stuff Jun-ho¡¯s articles full of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>their
</i>graphs, favoring <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>their </i>political beliefs,
and all written in the calm, reasonable tone Jun-ho associates with
intelligence.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn2' href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:
footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:"¸¼Àº °íµñ";mso-fareast-theme-font:

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>But we¡¯re getting ahead of ourselves. Taught
well, media literacy will encompass more than superficial indices of political
orientation. In addition to recognizing the warning signs of shoddy argument,
students will know how to compare smart-sounding claims by applying universal
principles of logic. They will learn, in other words, to think <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>critically.</i></p>

<h3>Critical Thinking</h3>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Here¡¯s the argument for teaching critical thinking: You can
teach students to identify biased media and purge it from their bibliographies,
but you can¡¯t delete the biased sources themselves. Unfortunately, bias is
everywhere, and students must learn to face it with a cool head. They need to
be able to argue against smart fascists as well as dumb ones.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In critical-thinking activities, students are
sent in search of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>academic</i> texts from
across the political spectrum. They put these sources ¡°in conversation¡± and attempt
to weigh their claims on objective grounds. For a textbook example of
critical-thinking pedagogy in action, consider the rise of Howard Zinn¡¯s <i>A
People¡¯s History of the United States of America</i> in progressively minded
syllabi. Zinn argued that the accepted narrative of history tends to privilege
the powerful and reinforce the dispossession of the masses. Thus, he wrote what
he called history from below, amplifying the voices of those who suffer when
others celebrate. However you feel about Zinn¡¯s scholarship, there is much to
admire about his moral resolution. A lifelong pacifist and advocate for civil
rights, he believed civic consciousness could only come from appreciating
history.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>But how do you teach ¡°appreciation¡±? I had a
Zinn teacher when I took US history in high school. Each class, our teacher
would place a chapter from the vanilla, state-sanctioned textbook alongside the
corresponding narrative from Zinn. We students debated and wrote about how the
¡°winners¡± and ¡°losers¡± of the event in question told their respective stories. Our
teacher noted that the winners tend to leverage historical narrative to justify
their own choices. (The losers, for their part, can find solidarity in
retelling forgotten stories.) In college, I would later recognize this as the
fundamental theorem of historiography.<span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='color:windowtext;vertical-align:baseline'><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>In the Zinn classroom, however, the lesson ends
here, with the banal admission that narratives have narrators and there is no
such thing as a neutral bystander. This is a restatement of the problem, not a solution.
And as Sam Wineburg points out, while Zinnist historiography tracks with modern
insights into the injustices of segregation and American imperialism, it
suffers from the same stridence that characterizes state texts. ¡°Such a history
atrophies our tolerance for complexity,¡± he writes. Rather than gaining a feel
for how historians work with primary sources and develop arguments, students in
the Zinn classroom might come to see history as a contest of moral authorities.
Think fast: will you cheer for David or Goliath?<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn3'
href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:
"¸¼Àº °íµñ";mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
KO;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA'>[3]</span></span><![endif]></span></span></a></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Of course, most educators don¡¯t set the two
contrasting textbooks on the table and ask the students to make a binary
choice. At this stage, someone usually brings up <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>nuance: </i>¡°It¡¯s not red or blue, but purple.¡± By May, the consensus in
my high-school US history class was that the state textbook wasn¡¯t so much
wrong as incomplete. If you spliced it together with Zinn, you could
approximate the truth.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Once it graduates from cage fights between
political tribes, critical-thinking epistemology arrives at a centrism: the
correct model of history sits somewhere between the conventional and
revisionist narratives. This is, inevitably, true. But just as media-literacy exercises
mistake woke shibboleths for truth, critical-thinking pedagogy mistakes certainty
for staying power. In the end, the narrative that gets fixed in students¡¯ minds
depends more on context and framing than objective truth. Imagine the history
class that would result from using the state textbook as the orthodox history,
and Newt and Callista Gingrich¡¯s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>A Nation
Like No Other: Why American Exceptionalism Matters </i>as the corrective. (Cue
podcast listeners, shrieking in the back about the Overton window.) This conditionality
is the very essence of the postmodern phenomenon that critical thinking claims
it can reverse. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Media-literacy and critical-thinking initiatives
are generally targeted at K&#8211;12 education. In the next section we¡¯ll turn to
higher education, where the feedback loop between research and teaching has
driven college pedagogy toward a different sense of intellectual integrity, one
motivated by an anxiety about universities¡¯ faltering institutional power.</p>

<h2>Narrative Fluency in Higher Education</h2>

<p class=MsoSubtitle>Should academics reach out or turn inward?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Those who advocate for media literacy and critical
thinking in K&#8211;12 champion intellectual diversity, but in the previous section we
saw how their curriculum actually herds students toward mainstream narratives. We
see a similar misalignment of goals and outcomes in higher education, where
reforms aimed at upholding ¡°complexity¡± discourage ambitious intellectual
projects.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>For better or worse, we assume college freshmen
can make basic distinctions between facts and opinions. Movements in higher
education invoke larger moral concerns about how we frame questions and apply
facts and methodologies in answering them. Academic specialization and public
scholarship are two examples of trends that seek to escape the
word-against-word debates characteristic of high-school pedagogy. But the way
they clamor after factual and moral certainties, we can detect the same
epistemological stridency. What scholars care about most of all is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>scholarship.</i> </p>

<h3>Specialization</h3>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Each fall, the various academic fields bear a new crop of
¡¦ subfields. I remember premed students at my undergrad enumerating the pros
and cons of a doing a degree in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>human </i>biology
as opposed to just biology. My sister studied biogeochemistry, which is what you
get when you take ecology and add math. When it comes to academic research,
precise scholarly units like these make confident conclusions about the
phenomena they study. But the same narrowness that grants them certainty also helps
them dodge the big, tough questions that exist prior to academic
departments&#8212;the very questions we depend on scholars to answer.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Let¡¯s focus on the discipline of history, which
has been fragmented by specialization and is now having second thoughts.
Compared to about fifty years ago, today¡¯s research historians work with
narrower date ranges, smaller geographic regions, and tighter demographic foci.
This trend, called microhistory, answers to a statistical suspicion about grand
narratives. Unlike historians in Marxist, feminist, and other ideological
traditions, who sought patterns in the historical record, microhistorians argue
that history is a Brownian process: technically determinist, but far too
complex to assess meaningfully. Thus, we need to zoom in. A typical
microhistory might examine the impact of a given subsidy on a local farming
community or a neighborhood church¡¯s liturgical practices before and after a regime
change. For microhistorians, the unit of research ought to be small enough to
discern individual collisions among people, actions, and places, lest we get
distracted by random patterns in the noise.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Recently, macrohistory (with an <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>a</i>) has staged a comeback. A new
generation of academics has come to question microhistory¡¯s political
agnosticism, and the average dissertation¡¯s timespan is widening again. Moreover,
thanks to new technologies and data-processing techniques, historians are
learning to make their work more relevant. History departments have surrendered
their loyalty to the tightly-reasoned 80,000-word thesis and are asking their
PhD students to code websites, produce documentaries, and compile digital
archives. The recrudescence of the long term earns a warm welcome from historians
Jo Guldi and David Armitage, who argue that the problem with microhistory is
that parochial histories of moments and places fail to answer meaningful historical
questions.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn4' href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:
"¸¼Àº °íµñ";mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
KO;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA'>[4]</span></span><![endif]></span></span></a></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Asked why things turn out the way they do, microhistory
can only throw its hands in the air and say, ¡°It¡¯s a snarl of conflicting
forces.¡± Forget Howard Zinn: Alex Jones will gladly bring a machete down on
this Gordian knot. His narratives, if bullshit, at least satisfy our desire for
explanations.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The work of history is to fish whys and hows
from the ocean of facts. When historians shy away from this task, they hand
their audience over to malevolent actors who will entertain them with facile,
seductive arguments about how history ¡°really¡± plays out. The same can be said
of increasing specialization in other academic fields.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Talented researchers who chase narrow
certainties leave it to ignorant pundits to answer the big questions. How can
we ensure that smart people receive some airtime, too? One group of academics
argues that the title of PhD confers a responsibility to educate the public.</p>

<h3>Public Scholarship</h3>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Historians¡¯ use of technology to upgrade their field¡¯s popular
standing exemplifies a push for public scholarship across all disciplines. Against
stereotypes of aloof professors who rest on the laurels of tenure, a cohort of
progressive academics argues that knowledgeable people must mobilize against
bad-faith narratives. And why shouldn¡¯t they? Democracy works best when the public
is well-informed. However, the intellectual compromises academics inevitably make
in their efforts at outreach raise doubts about the promises of public
scholarship.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Public scholarship looks different in every
field. My university¡¯s music school hosted a community-outreach program through
which students performed educational concerts in local public schools (I
participated). The law school let third-years substitute an internship at a law
firm for an elective course. And the international-relations department put
grad students through mock TV interviews, coaching them to answer expansive
questions about foreign policy in soundbite-sized paragraphs.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Public scholarship feels most urgent in the
sciences, where researchers seeking to dispel fake news have been (re)learning
to write for general readers about climate, health, and biology. For example,
in 2018, a group of geneticists at the University of Copenhagen identified a
statistical relationship between certain genetic signals and racial subgroups.
The lead author of their article, Fernando Racimo, knew that white nationalist
groups like to cite such studies in diatribes about ¡°race realism,¡± so he preempted
the disinformation campaign by uploading a Google doc summarizing the research and
disclaiming such interpretations. His goal was to ensure journalists wouldn¡¯t
omit the relevant hedges in their reporting on the study. To the joy of the
public-scholarship caucus, Racimo¡¯s strategy worked. After the researchers¡¯
findings were announced, journalists referenced Racimo¡¯s primer and included paragraphs
in their stories debunking shoddy racial science.<a style='mso-footnote-id:
ftn5' href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:
"¸¼Àº °íµñ";mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
KO;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA'>[5]</span></span><![endif]></span></span></a></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>But was Racimo¡¯s case the norm or the
exception? We must credit his campaign¡¯s success in part to the novelty of the
gesture: journalists found Racimo¡¯s Google doc&#8212;his rejection of scholarly
indifference&#8212;more newsworthy than the underlying research. Other
public-scholarship initiatives have not been so successful. Take a look at <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The Conversation</i> (<span
class=MsoHyperlink><a href="https://theconversation.com/">theconversation.com</a></span>),
a website designed to help academics communicate their research to a
nonspecialist audience. Its articles are worded precisely, hedged carefully,
and eminently boring. Browsing the website¡¯s comments, one senses that most of
its traffic comes from academics and nerds with expired university library
credentials&#8212;people like you and me, not the typical voter. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>The Conversation </i>makes a poor example of public scholarship because
it caters to people who <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>already</i> value
scholarship. And conversation, for that matter. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The mark of successful public scholarship isn¡¯t
whether it impresses other public scholars, but whether it changes the minds of
regular people. And as savvy envirosci grads know, to win skeptics over to the
reality of anthropogenic climate change, academics must speak in a lower
register and save the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>p</i>-values for
their colleagues. While some scholars possess both the endurance and charisma
to instruct the general public in complexity, on average, facile narratives
ring truer to human ears.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn6' href="#_ftn6"
name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:
"¸¼Àº °íµñ";mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
KO;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA'>[6]</span></span><![endif]></span></span></a> Thus,
before we drag academics¡¯ lackluster writing chops, we must confront the
possibility that academic conclusions&#8212;¡°assuming that,¡± ¡°in some circumstances,¡±
¡°given our current knowledge¡±&#8212;are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>necessarily</i>
deficient in the intuitive generalizations lay readers desire.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Because most people are not very smart, public
scholarship involves drawing compromises between intellectual honesty and
general accessibility: you can dumb down your results and score more converts,
or you can persist in fussy academic uncertainty and pray for an angel
journalist to see your hedged prose clearly. Academics believe more in the
methodologies of their colleagues than the reading-comprehension skills of journalists,
so they¡¯ve favored the latter approach (<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The
Conversation </i>is an example). But if the advocates of public scholarship
pursued their actual goal&#8212;winning the public over to academic consensus&#8212;they¡¯d exploit
the same cognitive cheat codes beloved by the purveyors of disinformation
across the aisle. We¡¯d have memes depicting napalm-tinged climate Armageddon
and schools shuttered for good by measles outbreaks.<span style='color:red'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>We¡¯re right back to where we started. It seems
that no matter how earnestly we try to redesign pedagogy in a way that protects
truth and rejects deception, such concepts as media literacy, critical
thinking, and public scholarship force us to choose one system of truth-telling
or another. They reproduce the very power structures they seek to dismantle.</p>

<h2>The Limits of Narrative Fluency</h2>

<p class=MsoSubtitle>Does narrative fluency solve the problems it sets out to?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The pedagogical currents described above aim for what I¡¯ve
been calling narrative fluency: the receptive ability to tease arguments apart and
examine their evidential bases, plus the productive ability to weave together original
arguments using facts (or ¡°facts¡±) and language. Far be it from me to deny the
value of skills like historical thinking and web design. If I were advising a
high-school civics teacher or history department chair today, and if they
assured me that my ideals wouldn¡¯t be drowned under the practical challenges of
teaching, I would likely tell them to draw from many of the pedagogical streams
I¡¯ve discussed. For all their limitations, creative pedagogies involving contemporary
problems and real media handily beat traditional facts-only teaching. Nonetheless,
let me voice two broad concerns about narrative fluency.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The first is that serial exercises in critical thinking
can engender a kind of epistemological complacency. After the professors
publish their op-eds, after the students grade them on the media-literacy
rubric, after MOGEF passes the most rigorous vetting&#8212;even in the face of all
this evidence, Jun-ho¡¯s mind may remain unchanged. And if someone should then challenge
his beliefs, Jun-ho can now say, ¡°I¡¯ve looked at all the facts and studies.
Have you? No? Then clearly <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>I¡¯m </i>not
the one who needs to give things a second thought.¡± Narrative fluency wants to
be a process for overturning our long-held assumptions, but it can just as
easily become an excuse for stubbornness.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>At the heart of the critical-thinking discourse
lies a spiritual belief that if we only think hard enough, we will arrive at
objective truth. But how do we know when we¡¯ve thought hard enough? The only
way we can be sure that narrative-fluency pedagogy is working is when it guides
people to the conclusions we have already decided they ought to reach. Those
who maintain fringe views despite the teacher¡¯s best efforts force us to
backtrack and ask what went wrong. Perhaps we didn¡¯t engage with the
counterargument thoroughly. Perhaps the sources lacked diversity. Perhaps Jun-ho
just isn¡¯t <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>getting </i>it. In any case,
narrative fluency gets to measure its own yardstick. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>My greatest concern about narrative fluency,
then, has to do with trust. Mastering the language of science helped a
generation of quacks trot out eugenic fantasies. Narrative is power: narrative
is morally fraught. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Pretend, for a moment, that we perfect narrative-fluency
pedagogy. We¡¯ve figured out how to teach every student to distinguish fact from
fake, analyze arguments critically, and write (or record, or code, or perform)
persuasive narratives of their own. Of course, only a subset of these students will
enter professional fields that grant them a public platform. And only an
idealistic subset of these will accept a life of financial insecurity to become
journalists, teachers, or university researchers whose ostensible goal is to tell
the correct story. The majority&#8212;and the most talented&#8212;of the narratively fluent
will work at PR firms, undertake research in private industry, or serve as in-house
legal counsel for multinational corporations. For narrative skill is highly
fungible. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>For a glimpse of a future in which narrative
fluency has been thoroughly commodified, consider the media-literacy program at
the Ross School, an exclusive prep school in Long Island. For $41,200 in yearly
tuition, they get to learn about the ¡°construction and deconstruction of
media,¡± spar with bright young minds, and gain entry into the tightest social
circles of tomorrow¡¯s big media. Ross¡¯s curriculum, and education journalist
Alexandria Neason¡¯s glowing review of it, demonstrates a familiar pattern in
pedagogical change: elite private schools set the pace, and the rest of the
education system plays catchup. Ross students are taking the best
media-literacy courses from the best teachers before everyone else. They will
retain a competitive advantage in the workforce for years to come.<a

KO;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA'>[7]</span></span><![endif]></span></span></a> <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>The pedagogy of narrative fluency upholds
itself as an antidote to moral bankruptcy, but at best, it is morally neutral. While
narrative intelligence may guide some to the right answers, for many students,
it will become a marketable aptitude alongside the familiar twenty-first century
skills of computer coding, tax minimization, and personal branding. (Indeed,
these skills themselves rely on a command of narrative.) Educators teach their
students about argument in school under the assumption that it will make them
more objective, conscientious citizens. But once these students graduate, they
find that the incentives are broken. There¡¯s far more money in manipulating the
masses on behalf of the powerful.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Good luck outsmarting them.</p>

Daniel Kahneman, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Thinking, Fast and Slow </i>(New
York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2011), chap. 9 discusses cognitive biases and
simplifying heuristics. These are psychological shortcuts that our mind uses
when making decisions and evaluating information, and they help explain why people
who ought to know better can have their judgment swayed by extraneous factors. For
example, readers tend not to trust text that is blurry or pixelated.</p>
