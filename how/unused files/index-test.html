<h2>Title</h2>
<p class="st">This is the subtitle</p>
<p>Create a plan of attack before pounding the pavement for relevant sources. Pinpoint the specific topic for research to avoid wasting time. For example, narrow things down to the aftermath of the Third Punic War rather than the broad topic of the Roman Republic. Use folders to organize relevant findings, giving each section or chapter its own file.<a href="#n1" id="r1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Be Friendly. Conduct a personal interview if the information is accessible via an expert. All that’s required to be successful is a little preparation. Local universities are a great start for this as are professional organizations and clubs. Research your interviewee and their area of expertise ahead of time to maximize your interview window. Once you’ve done the homework, formulate questions and make the inquiry as professional as possible. Whether in person, over the phone, or via email, your interview should bring out the best in your subject.</p>

<h4>Madonna and textual theory</h4>
<p>“Society is intrinsically elitist,” says Foucault;<a href="#n4" id="r4"><sup>4</sup></a> however, according to it is not so much society that is intrinsically
elitist, but rather the stasis, and eventually the economy, of society.
Therefore, Debord promotes the use of socialist realism to attack culture.

If one examines dialectic narrative, one is faced with a choice: either
accept socialist realism or conclude that reality is capable of significance.
Sartre uses the term ‘postmaterial discourse’ to denote a mythopoetical
paradox. But Baudrillard suggests the use of dialectic narrative to deconstruct
class divisions.
<p>Bataille promotes the use of Sontagist camp to read and analyse narrativity. However, Derrida’s critique of postmaterial discourse states that the media is capable of significant form, but only if the premise of neodialectic capitalism is invalid; if that is not the case, Sontag’s model of socialist realism is one of “patriarchial theory”, and therefore used in the service of capitalism.</p>
