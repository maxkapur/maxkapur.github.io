<h4>
 Public Scholarship
</h4>
<p>
 Historians’ use of technology to upgrade their field’s popular
standing exemplifies a push for public scholarship across all disciplines. Against
stereotypes of aloof professors who rest on the laurels of tenure, a cohort of
progressive academics argues that knowledgeable people must mobilize against
bad-faith narratives. And why shouldn’t they? Democracy works best when the public
is well-informed. However, the intellectual compromises academics inevitably make
in their efforts at outreach raise doubts about the promises of public
scholarship.

<p>
 Public scholarship looks different in every
field. My university’s music school hosted a community-outreach program through
which students performed educational concerts in local public schools (I
participated). The law school let third-years substitute an internship at a law
firm for an elective course. And the international-relations department put
grad students through mock TV interviews, coaching them to answer expansive
questions about foreign policy in soundbite-sized paragraphs.
</p>
<p>
 Public scholarship feels most urgent in the
sciences, where researchers seeking to dispel fake news have been (re)learning
to write for general readers about climate, health, and biology. For example,
in 2018, a group of geneticists at the University of Copenhagen identified a
statistical relationship between certain genetic signals and racial subgroups.
The lead author of their article, Fernando Racimo, knew that white nationalist
groups like to cite such studies in diatribes about “race realism,” so he preempted
the disinformation campaign by uploading a Google doc summarizing the research and
disclaiming such interpretations. His goal was to ensure journalists wouldn’t
omit the relevant hedges in their reporting on the study. To the joy of the
public-scholarship caucus, Racimo’s strategy worked. After the researchers’
findings were announced, journalists referenced Racimo’s primer and included paragraphs
in their stories debunking shoddy racial science.<a href="#ftn5" id="ftnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>
</p>

<p>
 But was Racimo’s case the norm or the
exception? We must credit his campaign’s success in part to the novelty of the
gesture: journalists found Racimo’s Google doc&#8212;his rejection of scholarly
indifference&#8212;more newsworthy than the underlying research. Other
public-scholarship initiatives have not been so successful. Take a look at
 <em><a href="https://theconversation.com/">The Conversation</a></em><em>,</em> 
a website designed to help academics communicate their research to a
nonspecialist audience. Its articles are worded precisely, hedged carefully,
and eminently boring. Browsing the website’s comments, one senses that most of
its traffic comes from academics and nerds with expired university library
credentials&#8212;people like you and me, not the typical voter. <em>The Conversation</em> makes a poor example of public scholarship because
it caters to people who
 <em>
  already
 </em>
 value
scholarship. And conversation, for that matter.

<p>
 The mark of successful public scholarship isn’t
whether it impresses other public scholars, but whether it changes the minds of
regular people. And as savvy envirosci grads know, to win skeptics over to the
reality of anthropogenic climate change, academics must speak in a lower
register and save the <em>p</em>-values for
their colleagues. While some scholars possess both the endurance and charisma
to instruct the general public in complexity, on average, facile narratives
ring truer to human ears.<a href="#ftn6" id="ftnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>
 Thus,
before we drag academics’ lackluster writing chops, we must confront the
possibility that academic conclusions&#8212;“assuming that,” “in some circumstances,”
“given our current knowledge”&#8212;are
 <em>
  necessarily
 </em>
 deficient in the intuitive generalizations lay readers desire.
</p>
<p>
 Because most people are not very smart, public
scholarship involves drawing compromises between intellectual honesty and
general accessibility: you can dumb down your results and score more converts,
or you can persist in fussy academic uncertainty and pray for an angel
journalist to see your hedged prose clearly. Academics believe more in the
methodologies of their colleagues than the reading-comprehension skills of journalists,
so they’ve favored the latter approach (<em>The
Conversation</em> is an example). But if the advocates of public scholarship
pursued their actual goal&#8212;winning the public over to academic consensus&#8212;they’d exploit
the same cognitive cheat codes beloved by the purveyors of disinformation
across the aisle. We’d have memes depicting napalm-tinged climate Armageddon
and schools shuttered for good by measles outbreaks.
</p>
<p>
 We’re right back to where we started. It seems
that no matter how earnestly we try to redesign pedagogy in a way that protects
truth and rejects deception, such concepts as media literacy, critical
thinking, and public scholarship force us to choose one system of truth-telling
or another. They reproduce the very power structures they seek to dismantle.
