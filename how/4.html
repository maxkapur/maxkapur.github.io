<h2>
 Narrative Fluency in Higher Education
</h2>
<p class="st">
 Should academics reach out or turn inward?
</p>
<p>
 Those who advocate for media literacy and critical
thinking in K&#8211;12 champion intellectual diversity, but in the previous section we
saw how their curriculum actually herds students toward mainstream narratives. We
see a similar misalignment of goals and outcomes in higher education, where
reforms aimed at upholding “complexity” discourage ambitious intellectual
projects.
</p>
<p>
 For better or worse, we assume college freshmen
can make basic distinctions between facts and opinions. Movements in higher
education invoke larger moral concerns about how we frame questions and apply
facts and methodologies in answering them. Academic specialization and public
scholarship are two examples of trends that seek to escape the
word-against-word debates characteristic of high-school pedagogy. But the way
they clamor after factual and moral certainties, we can detect the same
epistemological stridency. What scholars care about most of all is
 <em>
  scholarship.
 </em>
</p>
    

    
    
<h4 id="4a">
 Specialization
</h4>
<p>
 Each fall, the various academic fields bear a new crop of
… subfields. I remember premed students at my undergrad enumerating the pros
and cons of a doing a degree in
 <em>
  human
 </em>
 biology
as opposed to just biology. My sister studied biogeochemistry, which is what you
get when you take ecology and add math. When it comes to academic research,
precise scholarly units like these make confident conclusions about the
phenomena they study. But the same narrowness that grants them certainty also helps
them dodge the big, tough questions that exist prior to academic
departments&#8212;the very questions we depend on scholars to answer.
</p>
<div class="image"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ucblibraries/41689830995/"><img src="history.jpg" /></a><p>The work of the historian: arranging facts into narrative. <span><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ucblibraries/41689830995/">CU Boulder Libraries</a> via Flickr</span></div>
<p>
 Let’s focus on the discipline of history, which
has been fragmented by specialization and is now having second thoughts.
Today’s research historians tend to work with relatively
narrow date ranges, small geographic regions, and tight demographic foci.
This trend, called microhistory, answers to a statistical suspicion about grand
narratives. Unlike historians in Marxist, feminist, and other ideological
traditions, who sought patterns in the historical record, microhistorians argue
that history is a Brownian process: technically determinist, but far too
complex to assess meaningfully. Thus, we need to zoom in. A typical
microhistory might examine the impact of a given subsidy on a local farming
community or a neighborhood church’s liturgical practices before and after a regime
change. For microhistorians, the unit of research ought to be small enough to
discern individual collisions among people, actions, and places, lest we get
distracted by random patterns in the noise.
</p>
<p>
 Recently, macrohistory (with an <em>a</em>) has staged a comeback. A new
generation of academics has come to question microhistory’s political
agnosticism, and the average dissertation’s timespan is widening again. Moreover,
thanks to new technologies and data-processing techniques, historians are
learning to make their work more relevant. History departments have surrendered
their loyalty to the tightly-reasoned 80,000-word thesis and are asking their
PhD students to code websites, produce documentaries, and compile digital
archives. The recrudescence of the long term earns a warm welcome from historians
Jo Guldi and David Armitage, who argue that the problem with microhistory is
that parochial histories of moments and places fail to answer meaningful historical
questions.<a href="#ftn4" id="ftnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
 Asked why things turn out the way they do, microhistory
can only throw its hands in the air and say, “It’s a snarl of conflicting
forces.” Forget Howard Zinn: Alex Jones will gladly bring a machete down on
this Gordian knot. His narratives, if bullshit, at least satisfy our desire for
explanations.
</p>
<p>
 The work of history is to fish whys and hows
from the ocean of facts. When historians shy away from this task, they hand
their audience over to malevolent actors who will entertain them with facile,
seductive arguments about how history “really” plays out. The same can be said
of increasing specialization in other academic fields.
</p>
<p>
 Talented researchers who chase narrow
certainties leave it to ignorant pundits to answer the big questions. How can
we ensure that smart people receive some airtime, too? One group of academics
argues that the title of PhD confers a responsibility to educate the public.
</p>
    
    
    
<h4 id="4b">
 Public Scholarship
</h4>
<p>
 Historians’ use of technology to upgrade their field’s popular
standing exemplifies a push for public scholarship across all disciplines. Against
stereotypes of aloof professors who rest on the laurels of tenure, a cohort of
progressive academics argues that knowledgeable people must mobilize against
bad-faith narratives. And why shouldn’t they? Democracy works best when the public
is well-informed. However, the intellectual compromises academics inevitably make
in their efforts at outreach raise doubts about the promises of public
scholarship.

<p>
 Public scholarship looks different in every
field. My university’s music school hosted a community-outreach program through
which students performed educational concerts in local public schools (I
participated). The law school let third-years substitute an internship at a law
firm for an elective course. And the international-relations department put
grad students through mock TV interviews, coaching them to answer expansive
questions about foreign policy in soundbite-sized paragraphs.
</p>
<p>
 Public scholarship feels most urgent in the
sciences, where researchers seeking to dispel fake news have been (re)learning
to write for general readers about climate, health, and biology. For example,
in 2018, a group of geneticists at the University of Copenhagen identified a
statistical relationship between certain genetic signals and racial subgroups.
The lead author of their article, Fernando Racimo, knew that white nationalist
groups like to cite such studies in diatribes about “race realism,” so he preempted
the disinformation campaign by uploading a Google doc summarizing the research and
disclaiming such interpretations. His goal was to ensure journalists wouldn’t
omit the relevant hedges in their reporting on the study. To the joy of the
public-scholarship caucus, Racimo’s strategy worked. After the researchers’
findings were announced, journalists referenced Racimo’s primer and included paragraphs
in their stories debunking shoddy racial science.<a href="#ftn5" id="ftnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>
</p>

<p>
 But was Racimo’s case the norm or the
exception? We must credit his campaign’s success in part to the novelty of the
gesture: journalists found Racimo’s Google doc&#8212;his rejection of scholarly
indifference&#8212;more newsworthy than the underlying research. Other
public-scholarship initiatives have not been so successful. Take a look at
 <em><a href="https://theconversation.com/">The Conversation</a></em><em>,</em> 
a website designed to help academics communicate their research to a
nonspecialist audience. Its articles are worded precisely, hedged carefully,
and eminently boring. Browsing the website’s comments, one senses that most of
its traffic comes from academics and nerds with expired university library
credentials&#8212;people like you and me, not the typical voter. <em>The Conversation</em> makes a poor example of public scholarship because
it caters to people who
 <em>
  already
 </em>
 value
scholarship. And conversation, for that matter.
</p>

<p>
 The mark of successful public scholarship isn’t
whether it impresses other public scholars, but whether it changes the minds of
regular people. And as savvy envirosci grads know, to win skeptics over to the
reality of anthropogenic climate change, academics must speak in a lower
register and save the <em>p</em>-values for
their colleagues. While some scholars possess both the endurance and charisma
to instruct the general public in complexity, on average, facile narratives
ring truer to human ears.<a href="#ftn6" id="ftnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>
 Thus,
before we drag academics’ lackluster writing chops, we must confront the
possibility that academic conclusions&#8212;“assuming that,” “in some circumstances,”
“given our current knowledge”&#8212;are
 <em>
  necessarily
 </em>
 deficient in the intuitive generalizations lay readers desire.
</p>
<p>
 Because most people are not very smart, public
scholarship involves drawing compromises between intellectual honesty and
general accessibility: you can dumb down your results and score more converts,
or you can persist in fussy academic uncertainty and pray for an angel
journalist to see your hedged prose clearly. Academics believe more in the
methodologies of their colleagues than the reading-comprehension skills of journalists,
so they’ve favored the latter approach (<em>The
Conversation</em> is an example). But if the advocates of public scholarship
pursued their actual goal&#8212;winning the public over to academic consensus&#8212;they’d exploit
the same cognitive cheat codes beloved by the purveyors of disinformation
across the aisle. We’d have memes depicting napalm-tinged climate Armageddon
and schools shuttered for good by measles outbreaks.
</p>
<p>
 We’re right back to where we started. It seems
that no matter how earnestly we try to redesign pedagogy in a way that protects
truth and rejects deception, such concepts as media literacy, critical
thinking, and public scholarship force us to choose one system of truth-telling
or another. They reproduce the very power structures they seek to dismantle.
