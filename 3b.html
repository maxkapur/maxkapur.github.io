<h4>
 Critical Thinking
</h4>
<p>
 Here’s the argument for teaching critical thinking: You can
teach students to identify biased media and purge it from their bibliographies,
but you can’t delete the biased sources themselves. Unfortunately, bias is
everywhere, and students must learn to face it with a cool head. They need to
be able to argue against smart fascists as well as dumb ones.
</p>
<p>
 In critical-thinking activities, students are
sent in search of
 <em>
  academic
 </em>
 texts from
across the political spectrum. They put these sources “in conversation” and attempt
to weigh their claims on objective grounds. For a textbook example of
critical-thinking pedagogy in action, consider the rise of Howard Zinn’s
 <em>
  A
People’s History of the United States of America
 </em>
 in progressively minded
syllabi. Zinn argued that the accepted narrative of history tends to privilege
the powerful and reinforce the dispossession of the masses. Thus, he wrote what
he called history from below, amplifying the voices of those who suffer when
others celebrate. However you feel about Zinn’s scholarship, there is much to
admire about his moral resolution. A lifelong pacifist and advocate for civil
rights, he believed civic consciousness could only come from appreciating
history.
</p>
<p>
 But how do you teach “appreciation”? I had a
Zinn teacher when I took US history in high school. Each class, our teacher
would place a chapter from the vanilla, state-sanctioned textbook alongside the
corresponding narrative from Zinn. We students debated and wrote about how the
“winners” and “losers” of the event in question told their respective stories. Our
teacher noted that the winners tend to leverage historical narrative to justify
their own choices. (The losers, for their part, can find solidarity in
retelling forgotten stories.) In college, I would later recognize this as the
fundamental theorem of historiography.
</p>
<p>
 In the Zinn classroom, however, the lesson ends
here, with the banal admission that narratives have narrators and there is no
such thing as a neutral bystander. This is a restatement of the problem, not a solution.
And as Sam Wineburg points out, while Zinnist historiography tracks with modern
insights into the injustices of segregation and American imperialism, it
suffers from the same stridence that characterizes state texts. “Such a history
atrophies our tolerance for complexity,” he writes. Rather than gaining a feel
for how historians work with primary sources and develop arguments, students in
the Zinn classroom might come to see history as a contest of moral authorities.
Think fast: will you cheer for David or Goliath?<a href="#ftn3" id="ftnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
 Of course, most educators don’t set the two
contrasting textbooks on the table and ask the students to make a binary
choice. At this stage, someone usually brings up
 <em>
  nuance:
 </em>
 “It’s not red or blue, but purple.” By May, the consensus in
my high-school US history class was that the state textbook wasn’t so much
wrong as incomplete. If you spliced it together with Zinn, you could
approximate the truth.
</p>
<p>
 Once it graduates from cage fights between
political tribes, critical-thinking epistemology arrives at a centrism: the
correct model of history sits somewhere between the conventional and
revisionist narratives. This is, inevitably, true. But just as media-literacy exercises
mistake woke shibboleths for truth, critical-thinking pedagogy mistakes certainty
for staying power. In the end, the narrative that gets fixed in students’ minds
depends more on context and framing than objective truth. Imagine the history
class that would result from using the state textbook as the orthodox history,
and Newt and Callista Gingrich’s
 <em>
  A Nation
Like No Other: Why American Exceptionalism Matters
 </em>
 as the corrective. (Cue
podcast listeners, shrieking in the back about the Overton window.) This conditionality
is the very essence of the postmodern phenomenon that critical thinking claims
it can reverse.
</p>
<p>
 Media-literacy and critical-thinking initiatives
are generally targeted at K&#8211;12 education. In the next section we’ll turn to
higher education, where the feedback loop between research and teaching has
driven college pedagogy toward a different sense of intellectual integrity, one
motivated by an anxiety about universities’ faltering institutional power.
