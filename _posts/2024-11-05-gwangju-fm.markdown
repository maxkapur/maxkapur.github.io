This follow-up to my [previous post]( {% post_url 2024-11-02-gwangju-again %} ) about
the CLS alumni seminar to spotlight my favorite excursion of the week: A visit
to Gwangju 88.9 FM. 88.9 FM is a community radio station that hosts talk shows
on a variety of subjects, and dedicates part of its programming to covering the
international community in Gwangju. During our visit, our group of seminar 
participants divided into small groups, and had two hours each to produce a one-hour
broadcast.

This seemed like an impossible task at first, but ... I think the lesson here
is that time constraints can be very effective in forcing decisionmaking. At
work, we host live events in which participants have to develop a "course of action"
to deal with a challenging situation. Ensuring there is enough time to "flesh out"
these COAs is always a central concern in the design process. But I wonder now
if we have been asking the question the wrong way—instead of shaving down coffee
breaks to maximize discussion time, maybe instead we should be asking how we
can increase the *pace* of discussion and preserve a sense of forward motion
without creating room for discussions to go on and on without resolution.

Anyway: here’s our group’s broadcast.
