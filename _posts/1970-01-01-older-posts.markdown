“Where did the old blog go?” On June 25, 2022, I moved by blog from Google’s Blogger service to a Jekyll blog hosted on GitHub (which you are currently viewing). I have copied over all the posts from the old blog that I think are worth reading. Nonetheless, the original Illusion Slopes, whose content runs back to November 2015, is still accessible at [illusionslopes.blogspot.com](https://illusionslopes.blogspot.com/).
