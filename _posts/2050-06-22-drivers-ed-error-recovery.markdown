title: Driver’s ed should teach error recovery
---

I live near a one-way street, and drivers keep turning into it the wrong way by
mistake. Most react by getting flustered and reversing—dangerously—back into the
arterial, perhaps following an instinct to “undo” the error. The safer solution
(in my eyes) is to immediately park the car, get your bearings, then use a
driveway to get yourself pointed in the right direction once the coast is clear.

Unfortunately, driver’s ed doesn’t really teach you how to recover from errors
like this—certainly, mine didn’t.[^errors] Instead, it teaches you what the
rules of the road are and how to follow them. Once you have violated the
law—even if by accident—you are in undefined territory. This, I suspect, helps
explain the impulse to “reverse” errors like turning into a one-way rather than
to identify a safe course of action.

[^errors]: Well, my driver’s ed course did talk about what to do after you get
    in a collision: Exchange phone numbers, take lots of pictures, call the
    police, and get clear documentation of who was at fault.

The Federal Aviation Association promotes an idea called “just culture,” which
is better defined as what is isn’t: Just culture aims to replace a *punitive*
culture that addresses each safety violation with swift discipline of the
perpetrator. Instead,

    Time!” *FAA Safety Briefing,* January/February 2024, 7,

In the car world, there are clearly many safety violations, such as drunk
driving, street racing, cell phone use, and so on, that fall squarely into 
“blame” category. But others are better understood as inevitable errors of
inexperience. Another example I often see in city traffic is drivers get
stuck in the middle of an intersection when the light turns red. Of course, the 
driver’s manual says you should simply never enter an
intersection unless you know you have the time and space to clear it. But this
open-and-shut perspective doesn’t account for the real-world practice that drivers need
to hone the timing instinct. Nor the pressure received from other drivers
(sometimes imagined, other times real honking and yelling) to advance into a
marginally unsafe position. Nor how the previous factors interact with the
frequent anxiety new drivers experience on the road.[^redlight]

on my local one-way street in my neighborhood would probably find that it is
poorly marked.

(long version:)

Drivers keep turning the wrong way onto the one-way street near where I live.
Most of them immediately get flustered and reverse dangerously into traffic,
instinctively trying to “undo” the error. The safer solution (in my eyes) is
to park your car on the one-way (yes, facing the wrong way, but with clear
visibility and on a much less busy street), make sure the coast is clear, then
use a driveway to get yourself pointed in the right direction.

Unfortunately, driver’s ed doesn’t really teach you how to recover from errors
like this—certainly, mine didn't.\[^errors\] Instead, it teaches you what the
rules of the road are and how to follow them. Once you have violated the
law—even if by accident—you are in undefined territory. This is surprising to
anyone who has been outside, where drivers *regularly* make illegal turns or
get stranded in the middle of a crowded intersection as the light turns red.

Of course, the driver’s manual says you should simply never enter an
intersection unless you know you have the time and space to clear it. But this
sterile perspective doesn’t account for the real-world practice drivers need
to hone the timing instinct. Nor the pressure received from other drivers
(sometimes imagined, other times real honking and yelling) to advance into a
marginally unsafe position. Nor how the previous factors interact with the
frequent anxiety new drivers experience on the road.

Having a couple of strategies in mind for these situations would ease the new
drivers’ frequent anxiety, and protect people from doing something *more
dangerous* out of panic once they realize they’ve committed a moving
violation.

The Federal Aviation Association promotes an idea called “just culture.” Just
culture is the answer to a punitive culture that addresses each safety
violation by swiftly identifying the culpable party and imposing swift
disciplinary action. In the long run, punitive culture compromises the larger
mission (of providing safety) by failing to confront management practices
(such as time-efficiency metrics) that encourage unsafe practices and scare
away scrupulous junior staff. As an alternative

Upon inspection, the one-way street near me is poorly marked. Approaching it
from the highway, the first one-way street (which you cannot turn into) is
followed immediately by a second one-way street that points in the same
direction. Maddeningly, the first one-way street has no sign indicating as
much, and the second *does* have a sign, but it’s positioned exactly between
the two streets.

This means that many drivers, following their GPS, intend to turn into the
second one-way but end up turning into the first *because* they read the sign.
