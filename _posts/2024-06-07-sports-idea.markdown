A footrace, but the objective is to run as far as possible in a fixed amount of
time rather than speeding through a fixed distance. The catch is that the time
limit is drawn randomly at the start of the race, so you cannot strategize
around it being a sprint or distance event.

I think a good choice of distribution would be an log-normal distribution with a
mean of around four or five minutes and a fairly high variance. Perhaps we could
clamp the maximum time at eight hours, out of respect for the athletes’
work-life balance.

I ran (ha) this idea by a friend who is a competitive marathoner and he said,
“That sounds like hell.” This makes me think I am really onto something, because
many popular sports sound like hell to those who are not yet good at them.
