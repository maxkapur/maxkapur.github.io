A response to a post on
[deathbyabstraction.com](https://www.deathbyabstraction.com/I-love-programming-but-I-hate-the-programming-industry)
called “I love programming but I hate the programming industry”: **You might
enjoy my job, or something like it.**

I work at a consulting firm as a numerical modeling consultant. Typically, I
function as the “numbers guy” on a small project team of four or five people. We
put on live simulation, wargaming, and exercise events for clients who want to
assess risks to their operations or evaluate the usefulness of a new capability.
I build small simulations and data analysis tools to reflect back to exercise
participants what is happening in the room and the likely outcomes of their
actions. Others on the team provide expertise in the client’s domain, wrangle
event logistics and player materials, and moderate the discussion.

Outside of event facilitation, I also do traditional model-building of the “I
want you to model *x* using *y*” sort, where *x* is a real-world process and *y*
is a methodology. On these projects, I get to spend time with seasoned modelers,
read lots of papers, and hone my craft. It’s a nice balance.

Pro/con list below.<!--more-->

**Pro:**

- I have agency over the design and methodology.
- I choose (within client-provided constraints) the tech stack.
- I can practice soft skills, such as public speaking and sales, and learn about
  problem domains that I never knew existed.
- I interact with people from a wide range of academic and professional
  backgrounds. This includes both clients and coworkers.

**Con:**

- I can't blog much about my work or open-source my code and models due to
  sensitivities surrounding client intellectual property.
- Clients often request changes that I disagree with. Usually this is because
  they are right: they know something about the domain that I don’t, and my
  model reflects my ignorance. But sometimes they are wrong, and I have built
  a cathedral that will never see the light of day, let alone God.

(This entire post was mainly an excuse for the last line, which I scribbled in
my notes during a meeting and had to share.)
