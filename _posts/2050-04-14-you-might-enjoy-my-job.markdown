A response to a post on
[deathbyabstraction.com](https://www.deathbyabstraction.com/I-love-programming-but-I-hate-the-programming-industry)
called “I love programming but I hate the programming industry: On being a
faulty cog in a machine when the machine itself is faulty”: **You might enjoy my
job, or something like it.**

I work at a consulting firm as a numerical modeling consultant. Typically, I
function as the “numbers guy” on a small project team of four or five people. We
put on live simulation, wargaming, and exercise events for clients who want to
assess risks to their operations or evaluate the usefulness of a new capability.
I build numerical models and data analysis tools to reflect back to exercise
participants what is happening in the room and the likely outcomes. The rest of
the team provides expertise in the client’s domain, wrangles event logistics and
player materials, and facilitates. Outside of event facilitation, I also do
traditional model-building of the “I want you to model *x* using *y*” sort,
where *x* is a real-world process and *y* is a methodology.

Pro:

- I have agency over the design and methodology.
- I choose (within client-provided constraints) the tech stack.
- I get to practice new skills and interact with people from very different
  backgrounds.

Con:

- I can't blog much about my work or open-source my code and models due to
  sensitivities surrounding client intellectual property.
- Clients often request changes that I disagree with. Usually this is because
  they are right: they know something about the domain that I don’t, and my
  model reflects my ignorance. But sometimes they are wrong, and I have built
  a cathedral that will never see the light of day, let alone God.
