title:      "New job at Booz Allen Hamilton"
---

I’m happy to share a somewhat belated bit of good news: This month, I began a new job as an operations research analyst at the consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton. To fulfill this new role, I have moved to Arlington, Virginia, a suburb of DC with a mild climate and lots of natural beauty.

On this blog, I will continue to post short essays and notes about economics, math, and Korean. Please understand that any opinions expressed here are my own and do not represent those of my employer.

On my way out of Korea, I was able to make a celebratory trip to Naju and say farewell to my friends and coworkers at Geumseong Middle School and hike up to my favorite spot on the mountain. I have a tradition of listening to the Brahms Piano Trio in B Major at transitions like this. [Here’s one of my favorite interpretations.](https://www.youtube.com/embed/neyLy-xGgoE)
