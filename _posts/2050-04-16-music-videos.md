A side effect of my refusal to subscribe to Spotify (I just buy albums on
Bandcamp or used CDs) is that when someone sends me a song to listen to, I
usually look it up on YouTube and end up watching the music video. Because of
this, there are some songs or artists that I like more than I might have without
the video because the video adds an additional layer of interpretation.

I think I had mentally blocked myself from verbalizing this thought before
because of my background as a musician. I would like to think of myself as
someone who values the “music itself” and whose opinion of a song isn’t swayed
by the addition of a video track. After all, a music video is kind of like an
advertisement for the song or artist, a reference rather than the thing itself.

But then, I should have realized my susceptibility to music videos sooner,
because a big part of jazz school was learning how to *watch* jazz performances:
Musicians on stage employ a wide vocabulary of visual and bodily cues to steer
the ship while improvising.

And I went to a school whose music buildings were right next to the film
school—I think they actually had a small

somewhere. Lots of my classmates did collaborations with film or animation
students, but I went the other way, preferring to incorporate "analog" art like
poetry and fiction into my music by setting texts to melodies. A missed
opportunity.
