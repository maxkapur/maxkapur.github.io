title: CLS advice nobody asked for
---

Awesome people occasionally reach out to ask me about the US State Department’s
[Critical Language Scholarship](https://clscholarship.org/) (CLS) program.
I participated in CLS Korean in
2016, and I *still* find myself learning from the experiences I had in Gwangju
all those years ago (and that's with four additional years of living in Korea
and several visits in between).

This year’s CLS cohort is getting started now or so, so I thought I would
write up a couple of tips for making the most of the program that I’ve
collected and shared over the years.

1. Contribute ideas for activities to do with your language partner, because
   they may run out of them before long. Your outsider perspective might
   generate interesting adventures like visiting a family with young kids or
   sneaking into a college lecture.
2. Embrace a Zen attitude with respect to the language policy. Understand that
   some cohort members may need space to process new experiences and cultural
   differences in English; this doesn’t mean they are not getting the most of
   the program. Language acquisition doesn't have to be your *only* goal.
   (Context: CLS is famously an immersion-based program and requires
   participants to sign a language pledge saying that they won’t use English for
   the duration or the program. In retrospect, I was too much of a stickler
   about it.)
3. Identify and recognize your own stress responses and consider how they may
   contribute to or ameliorate the stress experienced by others. This is
   especially true for “elder” CLS participants (grad students and up), whom
   younger participants tend to see as role models in adapting to unforeseen
   challenges.
4. Buy an umbrella in Korea and
   [thank me later](https://www.cvs.com/shop/weather-station-folding-automatic-oversize-umbrella-assorted-colors-prodid-457782-reviews).

And please <a href="mailto:{{site.email}}">email me</a> if you are on CLS this
year and have any stories to share! I still have a
[few posts]({% post_url 2016-03-12-cls-korea %}) around
[from my CLS days]({% post_url 2016-06-25-first-week-class-cnu %}), but nothing
profound.
