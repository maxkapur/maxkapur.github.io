I have been measuring the leaves of my houseplants.

It <em>is</em> surprising how normal these distributions are.

I’m putting my stats notes

> **Note:** I imported this post from my Blogger archive on April 27, 2024. The original title was “Aretha and Brad”—the names of the houseplants (after Franklin and Mehldau, respectively) whose measurements are pictured. This mindfulness project was likely inspired by the beloved [iris dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set).
