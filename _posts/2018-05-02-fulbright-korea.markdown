Fun fact: the most-viewed post on this blog, by a long shot, is the one where [I shared that I'd received a Critical Language Scholarship](personal/korean/2016/03/12/cls-korea.html) from the US Department of State to study Korean in Gwangju. Today, I'm pleased to announce there will soon be another addition to the State Department&ndash;mandated disclaimer at the bottom of this blog.

Beginning early this July, I'll be spending a full year in South Korea as a Fulbright fellow. I'll be serving as an English teaching assistant at the elementary level. After our six-week orientation in Seoul, I don't yet know the city I'll be working in. That said, though Korea isn't a small country, it possesses an excellent transportation infrastructure. If you'll be there at all during the next year, send me an email so we can catch up!
