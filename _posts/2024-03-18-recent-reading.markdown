Mostly novels this time:

- 조남주, «82년생 김지영», a 2016 novel about (I have struggled to phrase this
  in a way that isn’t too dead-on) why it is so hard to be a woman in
  contemporary Korean society.

  The movie version from 2019 is better known, perhaps thanks to the sanitized
  resolution in which the title character learns to
  channel her resentment into creative energy—and writes the novel that
  the movie is based on. In the novel, however, the final chapter reveals
  the narrator as 지영’s therapist, and he comes within inches of a feminist
  awakening as he weighs different diagnoses for her, then reverses course.
  Witholding spoilers, I suspect that much of the hand-wringing around the book
  turns on its withering, cynical last sentence.

- 장강명, «한국이 싫어서», a novel about a woman’s decision to migrate from
  Korea to Australia, and for reasons that are no surprise if you’ve read the
  book above. This one has a happy ending.

- Mishele Maron, [“Anger Management”](https://thesunmagazine.org/issues/578/anger-management),
  (paywall), a memoir by a psychologist whose job was to “goad men with a
  history of violence into wanting to punch me” and create the opportunity for
  them to examine their feelings in group counseling.

- Greg Egan, *Permutation City.*

- Philip K. Dick, *The Man in the High Castle.*

I am looking for Korean bookstores that deliver within the US. So far
[반디북US](https://www.bandibookus.com/) has proven reliable, but I’d like
to have a backup option in case their rickety website finally gives way. Write
if you know of any others.
