Manuel Moreale, a tireless indie web advocate, recently
[had me as a guest on his People and Blogs series](https://manuelmoreale.com/pb-max-kapur)
([local mirror]({% post_url 2025-02-14-people-and-blogs-local %})).
Welcome to anyone visiting this site via Manu’s feed! Take a look around and
[let me know](mailto:{{ site.email }}) what you think.

I was super excited to be interviewed by Manu, as many of his writings have
sharpened my thinking around why I prefer blogging, email, and group chats to
brand-name social media:

- [On personal websites and social web](https://manuelmoreale.com/on-personal-websites-and-social-web)
- [Staying small](https://manuelmoreale.com/small-scale-is-the-best-scale)

Manu has compiled a lot of useful information for people trying to pivot from
social media, such as his
[list of blogging platforms](https://manuelmoreale.com/blog-platforms). If you
are one of the friends I’ve been trying to talk into creating a personal site,
definitely check out Manu’s list.
