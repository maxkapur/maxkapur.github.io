title:      "Mulberry: A college application strategist"
---

I recently created [Mulberry]({{ site.url }}/mulberry), a web app students
can use to compute their optimal college application strategy. It is a free,
open-source, user-friendly interface to Algorithm 1 from my
[MS thesis](https://github.com/maxkapur/CollegeApplication).

Why Mulberry? There are boatloads of “chance me!” websites (some more trustworthy
than others) that help students gather information
about colleges and estimate their chances of admission. But when it comes to the
question of *where* to apply (given that you can’t apply everywhere),
many people resort to folk wisdom, risk-averse heuristics, and gut feelings.

Mulberry complements these introspective techniques with dispassionate,
numbers-driven advice. You input estimates of your admissions chances at
each school and the amount of utility you associate with going there,
and Mulberry sorts the schools in the order you should apply
to them to maximize your expected utility.

The interface is at [maxkapur.com/mulberry]({{ site.url }}/mulberry),
and the code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/maxkapur/mulberry).
