Finished reading, but still thinking about:

- 정유정, «종의 기원», a thriller.
- 김연수, «이토록 평범한 미래», a collection of short stories.
- 권여선, «레몬», a thriller.
- 신경숙, «엄마를 부탁해», a classic.
- Cory Doctorow, *The Internet Con: How to Seize the Means of Computation,* a tinkerer’s manifesto.
- Paul Abel, [“I thought I wanted to be a professor. Then, I served on a hiring committee.”](https://www.science.org/content/article/i-thought-i-wanted-be-faculty-member-then-i-served-hiring-committee)
- From the September issue of *The Sun,* [“No Small Wonder”](https://thesunmagazine.org/issues/573/no-small-wonder) (paywall), an interview with psychologist Dacher Keltner, a student of awe. It pairs nicely with *Bewilderment* below.

Currently reading:

- Richard Powers, *Bewilderment,* a novel of astrobiology, biofeedback, and conservationism.
- 정유정, «내 심장을 쏴라», a thriller.
