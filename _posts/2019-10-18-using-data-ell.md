title:      Using data to understand ELL students
---

In August, I surveyed my students about their motivation for learning
English, their opinions about our class and my teaching style, and
what resources they were using to study English outside of class. By
analyzing the results using some of the statistical tools I&rsquo;ve
taught myself this year, I came up with some effective strategies for
reaching the disengaged students in my classroom.

At the moment this post goes up, I&rsquo;ll be giving a presentation
about that project at Fulbright Korea&rsquo;s fall conference in
Gyeongju. Here&rsquo;s
[a digital version of the talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgAhgY3TVEc).

And here&rsquo;s <a href="{{ site.url }}/esl-data/">a detailed
write-up of my survey design and results</a>.
