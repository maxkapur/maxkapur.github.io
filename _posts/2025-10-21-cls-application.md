This year's application for Critical Language Scholarship from the US State
Department is now [open](https://clscholarship.org/apply). (Thanks, group chat!)

CLS is a fully funded summer language immersion program for American
undergraduate and graduate students. I strongly encourage any interested in
learning one of the nine
[critical languages](https://clscholarship.org/languages) to apply. Some
languages require prior language study; others accept beginners.

*Feel free to <a href="mailto:{{site.email}}">email me</a>* if you are
considering the CLS program or have questions about the experience. I completed
CLS Korean in 2016 and have kept in touch with participants from lots of cohorts
since then. Here is my [advice post]({%- post_url 2025-06-26-cls-advice -%}).
