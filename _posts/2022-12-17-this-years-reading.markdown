A subset of the books I enjoyed this year:
- Barbara Kingsolver, *The Poisonwood Bible,* a novel about evangelical Christianity and cultural arrogance. 
- 손원평, «아몬드», a novel debating whether or not emotions are a distraction.
- Walter Isaacson, *The Codebreaker,* a biography of biochemist Jennifer Doudna.
- Michael Lewis, *The Undoing Project,* a biography of behavioral economists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky.
- 황보름, «어서 오세요, 휴남동 서점입니다», a slice-of-life novel about a bookstore owner overcoming the loneliness of urban life.
- Ayoko Sono, *Ningen no Bunzai,* a “collection of writings” (according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayako_Sono#Works), and I cannot come up with a better description). I read the Korean translation «약간의 거리를 둔다» by 김욱.
- 김애란, «달려라, 아비», short stories about the legacy of childhood experience.
- Jia Tolentino, *Trick Mirror,* essays about identity, authenticity, and social media.

In progress:
- 김금희, «너무 한낮의 연애», short stories about people at the margins of society. 
- David Foster Wallace, *Infinite Jest.*
