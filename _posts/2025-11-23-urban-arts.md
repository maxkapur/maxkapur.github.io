title: Urban Arts Career Pathways Takeover
layout: post

My team at work recently got to host a Career Pathways Takeover at
[Urban Arts](https://urbanarts.org/), a nonprofit based in New York that teaches
programming, animation, and storytelling education to high schoolers to prepare
them for success in college and beyond.

I was so impressed by the students’ thoughtfulness and engagement. We walked our
group of Game Academy students through our team’s event planning process, and in
less than an hour they put together a rock-solid plan for a community arts
program to raise awareness about mental health issues, including how they'd use
data to capture the event's positive impact (where I fit in). I hope the vision
can become a reality before long…!

Massive thanks the Urban Arts team for hosting us and for all that you do
through the Game Academy.
