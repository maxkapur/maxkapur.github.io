title: Authenticity and the Illusion Slopes AI policy
---

I attached my real name to this site. That means that above all, this site must
represent me *authentically.*

Authenticity is why I don’t use any generative AI tools in authoring or editing
my posts. Heck, I barely even use spellcheck. As
[Tracy Durnell writes](https://tracydurnell.com/2025/01/27/the-open-web-as-gift-economy-part-4/),

Authenticity also requires that I abandon any pretenses about what happens after
I inject my thoughts into the world. I don’t use AI, but I don’t use any
countermeasures against AI scrapers either, such as blocking OpenAI’s domains in
`robots.txt`. If the scrapers don’t get the text from here, they’ll get it from
GitHub, or from someone quoting me on another blog. Although I do not welcome
plagiarism, it’s a risk I accept as the price of participating in an
interconnected society. (If you want to reuse text from Illusion Slopes, see
[`LICENSE.txt`](/LICENSE.txt) for the terms.)

Finally, on the internet, it appears difficult to combine authenticity with
marketing. So, I don’t use Illusion Slopes to try to sell anything, nor do I
employ any marketing cookies or user fingerprinting tech to collect statistics
about the people who visit the site. Back when I used Blogger, I used to get
some “dumb” analytics about post views by IP geolocation, but now that I use a
[static site]({% post_url 2022-06-25-migrating-to-jekyll %}),
I don’t even know which posts are more or less popular. I like it that way; it
ensures I am writing for myself.

Putting this all together, I realize that the Illusion Slopes AI policy is
really a non-policy. I’m neither for nor against AI; it’s just “there,” a
technology that doesn’t have much to do with what this site is about. That could
change in the future, as the technology becomes more pervasive and harder to opt
out of (and hopefully more useful). But for now, I am happy with the incidental
benefits of failing to reposition my website for the AI era:

- Without AI-generated filler images or heavy JavaScript analytics, the site
  loads quickly (I hope?).
- Everyone who wants to read the site, can. I don’t have to worry about an
  aggressive anti-scraping filter that accidentally
  [blocks legitimate users]({% post_url 2050-02-10-check-prove-human %}).
- If I write something wrong, then won’t have to issue shallow excuses about
  how “the model told me so.” For better or worse, I own my errors.
