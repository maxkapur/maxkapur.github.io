Reasons (excuses?) that I cannot
[downgrade to a dumbphone](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/01/opinion/how-quit-smartphone-addiction.html):

- 2FA apps. You can set up a generic TOTP program on your computer, but that's
  not very convenient, and some organizations explicitly require you to use
  Microsoft or Google Authenticator. (I don’t know how they enforce this given
  that the algorithm for generating TOTP codes from the secret is an open
  standard.)
- My apartment building used to require an app to unlock the package room. The
  app is proprietary and probably not secure. The only alternative to the app is
  to bother the staff to open the package room for you.
- During the pandemic, Korea adopted a contact tracing system that involved
  scanning a QR code in an app on your phone at every business you entered. Many
  businesses would let you just write your phone number on a clipboard as an
  alternative, but some (Starbucks) required the app. Was the app secure? Has
  the database ever been breached? I sure hope not.
- Concert tickets from dice.fm. They have an exclusive deal with many venues
  that makes them the only place you can buy tickets, and their system requires
  you to store your tickets in their app, for anti-fraud reasons or whatever.
  (At smaller venues, if you don't have the app, they can manually verify your
  name on the guest list.)

I don't like that a smartphone has become a de facto requirement participation
in society. Smartphones have only *existed* for a few years. The main purpose of
the “prove you own a (smart)phone” tests that most commercial and government
services put you through these days seems to be to combat spam: Acquiring and
maintaining a non-VOIP phone number that can receive SMS messages is too
expensive for most spammers to do at scale. But
[again]({% post_url 2025-03-04-check-prove-human %}),
I resent that the burden of proof is on me to prove I’m not a spammer instead of
on the service to prove I am.
