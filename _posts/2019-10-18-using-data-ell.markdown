In August, I surveyed my students about their motivation for learning English, their opinions about our class and my teaching style, and what resources they were using to study English outside of class.

At the moment this post goes up, I&rsquo;ll be giving a presentation about that project at Fulbright Korea&rsquo;s fall conference in Gyeongju. Here&rsquo;s a digital version of the talk:
