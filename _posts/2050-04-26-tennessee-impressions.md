title: First impressions after moving to Tennessee

- *Honey, baby,* etc.
- Even young people have the accent. This surprised me because I thought that
  regional accents were slowly melting away thanks to mass media. In Korea, kids
  may have picked up a few regionalisms from family, but for the most part they
  spoke like the video game streamers they watched on YouTube. In Tennessee you
  can hear a southern accent even in young toddlers.
- Frequency of conversations with strangers is somewhat higher than on the
  coasts, but more noticeable is the length and depth of the conversations. I
  spoke for five minutes with a guy in the elevator and we kept having to stick
  our arms in the door to reopen it. We finally stopped talking when the
  elevator starting beeping at us and forced the door closed.
- Haven’t heard any cool southern aphorisms like “it’s all grist for the mill”
  yet, but my ears are open.
