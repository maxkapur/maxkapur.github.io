title: Newly excavated posts about teaching
---

When I migrated from Blogger to Jekyll a few years ago, I left a bunch of posts
behind, with the vague resolution of importing them at some point. Today, I
excavated a few more from the archives, all about teaching:

- <a href="{% post_url 2020-05-06-nonnative-teacher %}">The benefits of a
  nonnative teacher</a> (2020): A very long-winded way of saying that language
  learners often benefit from having a teacher who *isn’t* a native speaker of
  the target language, because then the teacher has empathy for the student. I
  think I stand by this take.
- <a href="{% post_url 2018-08-25-a-thing-here %}">Things that are a thing
  here</a> (2018): Just a few days into my Fulbright job, I was enamored with
  how seriously Korean teachers took their profession—and still am. But knowing
  what I do now, I would not write “Art, music, literature, and ‘morality’ class
  matter [in Korean schools] just as much as the STEM subjects.” Of course, all
  these subjects factor into your GPA, but as in the US, many Korean teachers
  and parents believe that the best jobs go to STEM graduates. And thus, even if
  it’s not their intention, they tend to celebrate students’ success in those
  subjects with a bit of extra energy.
- <a href="{% post_url 2017-08-31-students-as-creators %}">Centering students as
  creators</a> (2017): Notes from my undergrad internship. I think I see the
  germ here of an idea I’ve grown more certain of since: When you don’t know how
  to proceed, the first thing you should do is *start.* You know—open a
  document, put your name and the date, choose a font. These first steps shake
  off the fear of failure and assure the brain that it is safe to proceed.
