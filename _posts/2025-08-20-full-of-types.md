title: Full of types

I’m obsessed with this essay
["Raising a person in a culture full of types"](https://theoutline.com/post/8627/raising-a-teen-personality-types-growth-mindset)
by Dan Brooks. Before we get to the author’s message, let's take a moment to
appreciate his sense of comedic timing, e.g.:

> My son talks incessantly about VSCO girls and Karens and other categories of
> people he has learned about from YouTube. He described a classmate as “the
> kind of person who borrows your pencil and doesn’t give it back,” i.e. she
> borrowed his pencil and didn’t give it back. For a while he tried to propagate
> a type of his own invention, “the Suzan,” whose behavior was ill-defined but
> tracked closely with that of my mother of the same name. It did not catch on,
> and eventually he concluded that he was not the kind of person who could come
> up with memes.

Is it just me, or is this a highly clever paragraph?

Brooks's point, expressed better there than I will here, is that our culture's
emphasis on “being“ over “doing” prevents us from separating people’s actions
from their destiny. At best, the idea that people belong to fixed, inescapable
categories is merely the antithesis of the growth mindset; it saps motivation
from our desire to try new things (why learn programming if I am not a "math
person"?). At worst, as Brooks points out, "The illusion of a fixed nature gives
us an excuse to repeat bad behavior," because every mistake is like a movie
trailer for the rest of your life. And like a TV commercial, the fixed mindset
is an illusion with a *slope* (sorry): it inclines us toward the most automatic
decision instead of assessing the alternatives on their merits.

I will not pretend to be a paragon of the growth mindset. I talk myself out of
good ideas, such as learning how to actually cook, all the time. But if I could
choose to have one impact on the world, it would be to motivate those around me
to reject limiting beliefs and embrace challenge—even at the risk of failure.
And if linking you
[again](https://theoutline.com/post/8627/raising-a-teen-personality-types-growth-mindset)
to this essay, which has a wonderful subplot about fatherhood, is the way to do
it, then, OK.
