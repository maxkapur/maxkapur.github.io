I created a new logo for the site today:

![New logo: A stylized letter "M" formed by joining four segments with colors drawn from the site theme](/assets/logo-new.svg)

The old one was just a square with my initials, MK, which seemed a little too
self-indulgent (not to mention that I share these initials with half of my
extended family, so I can hardly claim them as my own):

![Old logo: The initials MK in green on a yellowish background](/assets/logo-old.svg)

The new logo still kind of forms a stylized letter *m,* if you imagine the three
theme-colored vertical segments as hanging from the horizontal segment on top.
It also *kind of* recalls the shape of the word *Ill,* which spells the start of
the blog title and doubles as a fun bit of retro slang.
