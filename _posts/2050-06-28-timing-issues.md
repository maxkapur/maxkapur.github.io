1. The Android Clock app has a
   [longstanding bug](https://forums.androidcentral.com/threads/alarm-clock-turns-off-by-itself-help.386881/)
   where the alarm will randomly disable itself. It may have something to do
   with the feature that shows a notification a half hour ahead of the alarm
   that lets you turn off the alarm if you wake up early on your own—maybe the
   button is clicking itself somehow? But this can’t be the full story, because
   sometimes I double check the night before that my alarm is set and find that
   it has instead been disabled for tomorrow and "will sound in 2 days." You can
   find similar bug reports on Reddit, but the issue occurs sporadically and is
   difficult to reproduce.
2. With the recent heat waves, my building has experienced several power blips
   which reset the clocks on the microwave and oven. My coffee machine is able
   to remember the clock time through each power blip, which is nice, except
   that for some reason it *doesn't* remember the "brew later" time. Result:
   fresh pot of hot coffee at midnight.
