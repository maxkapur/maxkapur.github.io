title: Is using a thesaurus cheating?
---

I remember taking mild offense when my middle school language arts teacher
introduced our class to the thesaurus. I thought, if I let the thesaurus choose
my words for me, then is it even *my* writing any more? This seems like a flaw
in my temperament: I always regard technology with suspicion when it threatens
to supplant human creativity.

Inevitably, as I progressed through high school and college, I made peace with
the thesaurus, and now I rely on it. A typical use case would be: “What’s that
word that means *deferential* but like, in an obnoxious way?” I plug the obvious
profanity into Merriam-Webster and it hands me back *obsequious.* I’ve trained
myself not to regard it as a creative failure if I accept this sort of help.
After all, it’s not like the thesaurus *tells* me which word to use; it just
brings it forth from the tip of my tongue.

OK, so this post had to be about generative AI, right? After a few years of
watching the world use and abuse large language models, I’m beginning to find
ways to accept an LLM’s assistance without feeling like I’ve outsourced my
creative process.

Mostly, I use LLM chat as a better search engine. For example, one of my first
questions (a few weeks ago) was “Is there a NumPy built-in that does this?” with
a quick example. The machine pointed me immediately to `numpy.unravel_index()`,
which was
[exactly](https://numpy.org/doc/2.2/reference/generated/numpy.unravel_index.html)
what I needed. It would have taken me much longer to get to the same answer with
Google.

Sometimes, I have tried more involved discussions with the chatbot to improve my
understanding of a technical concept. In lengthy conversations, I try to put a
lot of thought into my questions. I ask the LLM to check my assumptions, issue
corrections, and supply keywords I can look up in an official reference—but
never to generate code, text, or ideas. (Sometimes it does that anyway, which I
find highly annoying.)

“We use tools to embody their virtues,” writes
[Fernando Borretti](https://borretti.me/article/you-can-choose-tools-that-make-you-happy).
I guess I value [authenticity]({% post_url 2025-03-12-authenticity-ai-policy %})
or craftsmanship—my fingerprints on the finished product—more highly than laying
down as much code or text as I can in a fixed amount of time. This value
judgment (and it really is just that) precludes more aggressive uses of LLM tech
that, yes, might make me more productive in the short term. I’ll own that
tradeoff.

When it comes to new technology, we often speak of “early” and “late”
adopters—as though tech literacy means no more than riding the correct part of a
hype wave. My goal is to adopt tools not on the basis of urgent marketing or the
fear of being left behind, but because I can use that tool to make myself
smarter.
