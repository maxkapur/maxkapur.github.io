title: Is using a thesaurus cheating?
---

I remember taking mild offense when my middle school language arts teacher
introduced our class to the thesaurus. I thought, if let the thesaurus choose my
words from me, then it won’t be *my* writing anymore. By temperament, it seems,
I regard technology with suspicion when it threatens to supplant human
creativity.

But inevitably, as I progressed through high school or college, I made peace
with the thesaurus, even came to rely on it. A typical use case would be: “I
want a word that means *deferential* but like, in an obnoxious way but, like, it
isn’t this swear word I’m thinking of,” and then I would have Merriam-Webster
translate my profanity into *obsequious.* I trained myself not to regard
accepting this sort of help as a creative failure. to accept this sort of help
from the thesaurus. It’s not like the thesaurus *taught* me which word to use;
it just brought it forth from the tip of my tongue.

This post was obviously going to be about AI, right?

After a few years of watching others use and abuse LLMs, I think I’m beginning
to see how I can accept the assistance of an LLM without feeling like I’ve
outsourced my creative process. I mostly use LLMs as a better search engine. The
interaction that sold me was when I asked an LLM, “Is there a NumPy built-in
that does this?” and supplied a quick example. The machine pointed me
immediately to `numpy.unravel_index()`, which was
[exactly](https://numpy.org/doc/2.2/reference/generated/numpy.unravel_index.html)
what I needed.

When I get into a more involved discussion, I try to put a lot of thought into
the questions I ask the LLM, and try to use it to check my understanding or
identify keywords I can look up in an official reference rather than having the
LLM generate ideas from whole cloth. (Claude likes to tell me “Your intuition is
spot-on!” and then summarize what I said in more precise language. I asked it if
it was just agreeing with me to be nice and it said no, so I guess that means I
win?)

When it comes to new technology, we often speak of early adopters and late
adopters as though the most important dimension of tech literacy is your ability
to ride a hype wave. My goal is to adopt new tools not on the basis of hype or
fear of being left behind, but because I am confident that I can take advantage
of them in a way that makes me smarter, not dumber.
