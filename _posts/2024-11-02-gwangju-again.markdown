title: Gwangju again
---

I had the honor this week of participating in the first ever
[Critical Language Scholarship Alumni Seminar](TODO) at Chonnam National
University. This was an unforgettable opportunity for three reasons:

1. The seminar offered a priceless opportunity to reflect on the significance of
   democracy. Korea did not adopt a democratic constitution until 1987, so the
   memory of authoriarian rule is still quite fresh. Koreans therefore do not
   take their democracy for granted, as evidenced by the high degree of civic
   participation.

   Our seminar focused on the intersection of democracy and media literacy. We
   heard several interesting lectures about the 5/18 independence movement and
   government crackdown in 1980. Through the ’80s, citizen journalists played a
   crucial role in resisting media censorship and spreading the truth about
   state violence through informal publications. I was encouraged to hear from a
   panel of student journalists at CNU about...

2. This is a special moment in Gwangju’s history as the world celebrates the
   author Han Kang’s receipt of the Nobel Prize. Han Kang was born in Gwangju,
   and one of her novels, *Human Acts* (소년이 온다), memorializes the 5/18
   independence movement. I have only read *The Vegetarian,* so I have to add
   this book to the stack.

3. I got to return to the exact institution where I did [CLS in 2016](TODO)—my
   first visit to Korea—with the added perspective of eight more years of Korean
   study and four years of living in the country.

   I was shy during CLS and didn’t explore much of the city, but on this visit,
   the only limiting factor was time. After the seminar, I took a day to walk
   all around the Asian Cultural Center, an endless arts and culture complex. My
   highlight was *Delivery Dancer’s Arc: Inverse,* a massive video installation
   from the studio of science fiction creator, whom I previously knew only as a
   writer. I also enjoyed the ACC’s library, which has a really nice reference
   area with art magazines and comfy chairs.
