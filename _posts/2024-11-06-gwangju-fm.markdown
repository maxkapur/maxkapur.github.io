I wanted to follow up on my [previous post]( {% post_url
2024-11-02-gwangju-again %} ) about the CLS alumni seminar in Gwangju to
spotlight **my favorite excursion of the week: our visit to the [88.9 Gwangju
FM]( https://kjfm.communityradio.kr/ )** community radio station. Gwangju FM has
no particular theme, but they dedicate part of their schedule each week to
programming related to the Gwangju international community. When our group of
twenty-five showed up, the staff divided us into five groups and gave us two
hours each to produce a one-hour broadcast on a topic of our choice.

The task seemed impossible when the guide explained it to me (at work, we
routinely spend *weeks* choreographing what amounts to a brief slideshow
presentation), but the time pressure worked to our group’s advantage: all we
could really do was create a list of discussion questions and songs to provide
forward motion, then improvise from there. We ended up having a [spirited
discussion](

) about media literacy and news consumption. (Email me if the link breaks and I
will upload an MP3 instead.)

After our group disbanded in Gwangju, I got to spend a few days in Naju, my
“second hometown” where I taught English for two years as a Fulbright grantee. I
tried a new (to me) gomtang place called 나주곰탕사매기, which has a cool
aquarium, a garden, and even birds! A few pics below.<!--more-->

Here is their garden:

And here is the soup:
