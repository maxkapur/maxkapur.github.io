Illusion Slopes is a personal blog. I write about whatever’s on my mind. My goal
is to document my thoughts and gain perspective on how they have evolved since
starting this site as a college student in 2016. I’m also interested in
connecting with readers who have similar life experiences or contrasting
viewpoints.

I’m enthusiastic about the indie web and the possibilities the internet holds as
a platform for personal expression and human connection—you know, what social
media was supposed to be. I try, on this site, to be maximally
[authentic]({% post_url 2025-03-12-authenticity-ai-policy %}), which means no
AI and no marketing.

Here’s what I look like:

# Bio

I currently work as an operations research analyst at a private consulting firm,
where I use modeling, simulation, numerical optimization, and algorithmic game
theory to solve client problems in a variety of sectors.

In 2022, I completed my master&rsquo;s degree in industrial engineering at Seoul
National University, where my [thesis
research](https://github.com/maxkapur/CollegeApplication) concerned numerical
modeling of college admissions markets. I also worked as a research assistant in
the
[Management Science/Optimization Lab](https://web.archive.org/web/20230323144548/http://polytope.snu.ac.kr/)
at SNU, where I supported a variety of projects related to linear and nonlinear
programming, combinatorial optimization, and urban transit network models.

Prior to my studies at SNU, I taught English for two years as a US State
Department Fulbright scholar at a middle school in Naju, South Korea. I
graduated from the University of Southern California in 2018 with degrees in
jazz piano and Korean in 2018; here’s my [senior recital
video](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL06yMQdXWrp9VsynaPe2mg2gjHfr45VZO).

I especially love hearing from applicants and current participants about the US
State Department&rsquo;s Fulbright and Critical Language scholarships and the
Government of Korea Scholarship, all of which were transformative experiences in
my personal and professional life.
