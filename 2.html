 Thesis Statement
</h2>
<p class="st">
 What is the pedagogy of narrative fluency, and where does
it fall short?
</p>
<p>
 The aim of liberal-arts classes like foreign languages,
history, and social studies is to teach students how to handle information. Information
is more than just data and facts, grammar and vocab. Postmodernism tells us
that information is never far from narrative&#8212;good- and bad-faith narratives,
fictional and nonfictional narratives, and downright fake narratives. Today, the
ability to assess bias and generate compelling original arguments is no longer an
abstract exercise, but an essential survival skill. Cases like Jun-ho’s,
however, remind us that pedagogical ideals like media literacy, critical
thinking, and intellectual responsibility are difficult to package in a lesson
plan.
</p>
<p>
 Social-science educators, recognizing the
importance of narrative skills, have abandoned traditional practices like
memorization and translation in favor of discursive models suited to our
postmodern environment. In K&#8211;12 education, media-literacy and critical-thinking
activities aim to help students sort facts from opinions and detect bias (or
malice) in media. In higher ed, meanwhile, the conversation centers around protecting
the intellectual standing of academia and dissuading the public from phony news
sites and bad science. While these initiatives’ immediate goals vary, all
invest in what I call narrative fluency: the ability to dissemble narratives
into claims of fact and assemble facts into compelling narratives.
</p>
<p>
 The pedagogy of narrative fluency misses the
mark in two crucial ways. First, it situates the machinery of disinformation
outside the student's mind, as though objectivity can be reached if we only
think hard enough. In fact, it's the pleasant delusion of objective witness
that makes bad-faith narratives so infectious. Second, narrative fluency
advertises itself as a moral tonic, but at best it is morally neutral, and in
practice it backfires easily. Some students who absorb the lessons of narrative
fluency will become woke journalists or grassroots politicians, but those who
are savvy enough to measure the broken incentives of the modern economy will
recognize that they can make a lot more money by turning their back on humanist
ideals and manipulating their peers for pay.
</p>
<p>
 It should therefore come as no surprise that
elite schools promise that their students are the most narratively fluent of
all. Narrative fluency, like similar pedagogical trends that went before it, is
already helping the wealthy safeguard their influence from generational change.
