This repository holds my personal blog, Illusion Slopes, which can be viewed at [maxkapur.com](https://maxkapur.com).

It also used to host several one-off essays, but these have have now been moved to separate repos, namely [cyborgs-and-ciphers](https://github.com/maxkapur/cyborgs-and-ciphers), [esl-data](https://github.com/maxkapur/esl-data), and [how-do-we](https://github.com/maxkapur/how-do-we).
