    <p>I live near a one-way street, and drivers keep turning into it the wrong way by
mistake. Most react by getting flustered and backing dangerously into the
arterial, perhaps following an instinct to “undo” the error. The safer solution
(in my eyes) is to park the car, wait for traffic to clear, then use a driveway
to point yourself in the right direction.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, driver’s ed doesn’t teach you how to recover from mistakes like
this—at least, mine didn’t. Instead, driver’s ed teaches the rules of the
road and how to follow them. Once you have violated the law, even if by
accident, you are in undefined territory. Hence, drivers develop a strong
impulse to immediately “reverse” errors rather than identify a safe course of
action.<!--more--><sup id="fnref:errors"><a href="#fn:errors" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p>The Federal Aviation Association has invested considerable effort into
identifying the root causes of safety incidents and increasing safety baselines.
They promote an idea called “just culture” as the alternative to a <em>punitive</em>
culture that addresses each safety violation with swift discipline. Instead,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Safety inspectors must understand the difference between accountability, which
accepts responsibility and looks forward, and blame, which focuses on
punishment for what has already occurred. The key to a just safety culture is
the ability to determine where the line should be drawn between unsafe acts
that can be effectively addressed by using compliance tools (accountability)
and unacceptable behavior that requires the use of enforcement action
(blame).<sup id="fnref:faa"><a href="#fn:faa" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the car world, many safety violations, such as drunk driving, street racing,
cell phone use, and so on, fall squarely into the “blame the driver” category.
But others are better understood as symptoms of inexperience, reasonable
reactions to <em>other</em> drivers’ unsafe actions, or simply the inevitable
consequences of poor signage. (Here I have deleted two paragraphs complaining
about the placement of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ONE WAY</code> signs in my neighborhood.) The blame
belongs to multiple parties, and punishing only one yields only a marginal
improvement in safety.</p>

<p>Another example we often see in city traffic is drivers who get stuck in the
middle of an intersection when the light turns red. Of course, the driver’s
manual says plainly that you should never enter an intersection unless you have
the time and space to clear it. But this open-and-shut perspective doesn’t
account for the real-world practice that drivers need to hone the timing
instinct. Nor the pressure received from other drivers (sometimes imagined,
other times real honking and yelling) to advance into an unsafe position. Nor
how the previous factors interact with the frequent anxiety new drivers
experience on the road. I am not saying that we should legalize running red
lights, only pointing out that the <em>perception</em> that every unsafe situation
flows from an individual’s culpable act makes it harder to identify safety
improvements that require coordinated action.</p>

<p>I <em>still</em> don’t know the safe way to get out of the red light situation, nor how
best to react (e.g. as a pedestrian crossing the street) when I see someone make
that mistake. So, yeah, as the title suggests, I wish that driver’s ed taught
strategies for dealing from these common errors, even a simple suggestion such
as “Try to focus on how to make the situation safe <em>now</em> rather than what you
<em>shouldn’t have</em> done.“</p>

<p>Generalizations to corporate governance, cybersecurity, academia, and so on are
left to the reader.</p>
