<p>I’ve given a lot of thought to how to organize this projects page now that I
work for a private company. The truth is that I do my <em>best work</em> for my
employer, because my employer gives me the two resources I need to produce good
stuff: awesome colleagues, and time (in that order). But rattling off a list of
all my clients and work projects here on Illusion Slopes would undermine my goal
of maintaining a healthy separation between my personal and professional
identities. As a compromise, I hope this spiel from my <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/pb-max-kapur">People and Blogs
interview</a> (<a href="/2025/02/14/people-and-blogs-local.html">local
mirror</a>) will suffice as an
introduction:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At work, I build numerical modeling tools (picture something like <a href="https://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/">Universal
Paperclips</a>) for clients who are
sometimes skeptical of analyzing their data quantitatively. That’s because
they’ve been disappointed by past attempts that failed to account for the
right variables, or that offered too much technical flourish with too little
explanation. So, in my role, equally important to getting the math right is my
ability to tell a convincing story about why I modeled the problem a certain
way. That’s where I draw on my teaching background, the performance skills I
learned in music school, and my ability to translate specialized concepts into
accessible terms.</p>
