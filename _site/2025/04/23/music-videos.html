And I went to a school whose music buildings were right next to the film school—I think they actually had a small scoring stage somewhere. Lots of my classmates did collaborations with film or animation students, but I went the other way, preferring to incorporate “analog” art like poetry and fiction into my music by setting texts to melodies.
