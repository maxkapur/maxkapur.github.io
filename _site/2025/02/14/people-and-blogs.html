Welcome to anyone visiting this site via Manu’s feed! Take a look around and
<a href="mailto:max@maxkapur.com">let me know</a> what you think.</p>

<p>I was super excited to be interviewed by Manu, as many of his writings have
sharpened my thinking around why I prefer blogging, email, and group chats to
brand-name social media:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/on-personal-websites-and-social-web">On personal websites and social web</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/small-scale-is-the-best-scale">Staying small</a></li>

<p>Manu has compiled a lot of useful information for people trying to pivot from
social media, such as his
<a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/blog-platforms">list of blogging platforms</a>. If you
are one of the friends I’ve been trying to talk into creating a personal site,
