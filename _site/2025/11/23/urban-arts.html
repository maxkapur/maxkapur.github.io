I was so impressed by the students’ thoughtfulness and engagement. We walked our group of Game Academy students through our team’s event planning process, and in less than an hour they put together a rock-solid plan for a community arts program to raise awareness about mental health issues, including how they’d use data to capture the event’s positive impact (where I fit in). I hope the vision can become a reality before long…! Massive thanks the Urban Arts team for hosting us and for all that you do through the Game Academy." />
