        </h2><p>In advance of a conference I will be attending with my labmates next month in Jeju, my thesis advisor and I have posted a preliminary version of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01869">“The College Application Problem” on arXiv</a>. Here’s the abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This paper considers the maximization of the expected maximum value of a portfolio of random variables subject to a budget constraint. We refer to this as the optimal college application problem. When each variable’s cost, or each college’s application fee, is identical, we show that the optimal portfolios are nested in the budget constraint, yielding an exact polynomial-time algorithm. When colleges differ in their application fees, we show that the problem is NP-complete. We provide four algorithms for this more general setup: a branch-and-bound routine, a dynamic program that produces an exact solution in pseudopolynomial time, a different dynamic program that yields a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme, and a simulated-annealing heuristic. Numerical experiments demonstrate the algorithms’ accuracy and efficiency.</p>

            Administrative vs. allocative efficiency

        </h2><p>This fall marks my final semester of coursework, and penultimate semester overall, of the master’s course in industrial engineering here at Seoul National University. I’m taking courses in combinatorial optimization and advanced microeconomics, as well as continuing my study of college admissions markets as a research assistant in the  Management Science/Optimization Lab.</p>

<p>Recently, I have been focusing on risk-averse behavior in college applications. In an ideal universe, college applications are completely standardized and there are no constraints on students’ ability to apply to many schools or on schools’ ability to assess a large number of applicants. In reality, many highly qualified students fail to apply to top schools because they doubt their ability to get in or receive a sufficient financial-aid package. For these students, the time and money required to submit an additional application to a so-called reach school takes away from time that could be spent refining an application to a target school. This opportunity cost is not trivial, because modern admissions offices strongly prefer students who tailor their personal statement to the characteristics and interests of the target school or program.</p>

            An economic view of the Korean college admissions market
          </a>
        </h2><p>Existing computational models of admissions markets tend to fall at one of two extremes: Either they envision a <em>centralized</em> admissions process in which the school board runs an algorithm that says which students go where, or a <em>decentralized</em> process in which colleges compete for the best students. But the Korean college admissions process cannot be adequately described in either of these terms.</p>

            Stable matching on Planet Money
          </a>
        </h2><p><em>Planet Money,</em> an NPR show about economics, recently ran an <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/03/02/972943944/the-marriage-pact">episode entitled “The Marriage Pact”</a> that deals precisely with my research topic. It’s a great episode that discusses both the basic ideas behind stable assignment as well as its applications in organ donation, job placement, and (my area of focus) school choice.</p>

<p>The episode begins with an interview with a Stanford econ student who designed a marriage market for his peers and managed to get 4111 of them to sign up for it. What a cool project! The student makes a few minor misstatements about the Gale–Shapley proposal algorithm that <em>Planet Money</em> leaves uncorrected. In this post, I want to offer a few corrections, not just because I can, but because in my opinion these marginal details are what make stable assignment an interesting and profitable research topic.</p>
