English, their opinions about our class and my teaching style, and
what resources they were using to study English outside of class. By
analyzing the results using some of the statistical tools I’ve
taught myself this year, I came up with some effective strategies for

            Things that are a thing here
          </a>
        </h2><p>They say that major lifestyle changes—even positive ones, like starting a new
job or moving—are one of the biggest stressors out there. By that measure, it’s
been a wild week: I’ve moved in with my host family in Naju, set up a Korean
bank account and phone number in my name, and started teaching English at two
middle schools. Unfamiliar digs, unfamiliar language, unfamiliar students and
coworkers. But on all sides, I’ve been fortunate to find myself surrounded by
supportive, understanding, and hardworking people.</p>

<p>Skip these two paragraphs if I already told you about my weekly schedule. I
spend Monday through Thursday at an all-boys’ middle school in Naju’s old town.
At about forty students in each grade (divided into two classes), it’s smaller
than average, but our students more than make up for it with their rambunctious
energy. Fridays, I’m out in the countryside in an actually tiny one-building
school that has only twenty-five or so students (it’s the satellite of a school
in a neighboring city), all very proper and devoted to their grade-level
classmates. The second school is in a gorgeous setting: epic mountains pouring
down fog from all sides.</p>

<p>At my main school, each homeroom gets English class two or three times a week; I
teach one class and my supervising coteacher teaches the other. After school, I
teach a smaller group of students an English conversation class (the students
are all required to participate in a club class but they get to choose from
various school subjects). I expected the large classes to be the hard part
because of, you know, crowd control. But the club classes have proven more
challenging because they expose the students whose English isn’t as strong. Half
of the students are bored because they understand nothing, and the other half is
bored of waiting for the former to catch up. This situation calls for creative
pedagogy. I don’t know what that’ll look like yet, exactly.</p>

<p>Now, I’ll do my utmost not to be that foreigner who windbags about “how the
Koreans do it.” So, with the caveat that I do not intend to define cultural
differences comprehensively, let me share two things have stood out to me this
week: First, it’s really striking how much authority teachers have here. Despite
my youth and inexperience, my fellow teachers place a lot of faith (certainly
undue) in my ability to plan solid classes. They’ve given me a textbook to
follow, along with ample supplies and auxiliary materials, but nobody has nagged
me for any bureaucratic nonsense like a tabular correlation of my lesson plans
with those of my supervisor. The team trusts that I’ll do the work well, and I
do my best to meet their expectations.</p>

<p>Observation number two: There’s a stereotype that Korean schools teach
everything by rote, but to me, this appears to be more of a generational
difference than a cultural one. If anything, it’s kids in the US who suffer
truly tedious classes, structured the same way every day (“I will be able
to … ”), because American teachers’ livelihood depends so desperately on their
students’ standardized test scores. While standardized tests are also a big deal
in Korea, teachers themselves seem to assign (and are permitted to assign)
students’ overall learning and well-being more importance. Additionally, my
students in Korea take a much wider variety of subjects than their American
counterparts. Art, music, literature, and “morality” class<sup id="fnref:morality"><a href="#fn:morality" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> matter
just as much as the STEM subjects, whereas the schools I’ve worked at in the
States seemed to treat anything that isn’t quantitative as an ancillary. (But
then, I did grow up in the shadow of Microsoft, Boeing, and Amazon.)</p>

<p>In short, I really love my job. Call this the honeymoon phase, but I want to
gush about one more thing while I’m riding high: On my first day, I received
from the vice principal a tabbed, leather-bound notebook labeled “Teacher’s
Diary.” I chuckled at the odd English, thinking it was just a regular planner,
but it isn’t. Many of the teachers at our school actually keep a journal, in
prose, reflecting on their daily lessons and pondering ways to improve their
pedagogy. I’ve started doing the same. And I can already feel it making me more
present in the classroom, more aware of how my students are faring. I mean, why
wasn’t this a thing in my high school?</p>

<div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:morality">
      <p>I <em>really</em> want to observe this one. I was leafing through the
morality textbook and it consists mostly of short parables and comic strips,
which students read and then respond to with brief journal entries. When I
remarked to another teacher that there are no such classes in America, she
asked if we just learned morality during philosophy class. I told her we
don’t normally have philosophy classes in grade school either. She turned
back to her computer, looking perplexed. <a href="#fnref:morality" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

            Centering students as creators
          </a>
        </h2><p>In an influential article
<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00043125.2007.11651621" alt="Olivia Gude, &quot;Principles of Possibility,&quot; Art Education, Jan. 2007, 6&ndash;17">reimagining
how we teach art in the modern classroom</a>, Olivia Gude observes that when
students set about “looking for and developing images from inkblots, smoke
marks, or wax drippings,” even the artistically checked-out ones begin to
recognize themselves as creators:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Initially, students may be confused and suspicious—claiming they don’t see
anything in the blurs and blobs, but as peers and teachers model an
experimental attitude, soon the classroom is filled with exclamations as new
images and combinations are spontaneously discovered. Students who are taught
to access the creative unconscious don’t drive teachers mad complaining, “I
don’t have an idea.” These students have learned the important artistic lesson
that artists do not know the outcomes of their works before they begin.
Artists immerse themselves in a process of making and sensitively interact
with images and ideas as they emerge.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We would do well to follow Gude’s lead in other fields of art education, too.
When I interned at <a href="https://fearlessideas.org/">The Greater Seattle
Bureau of Fearless Ideas</a> this summer, I noticed the staff was well prepared
for students who would claim, “I’m really not the creative type.” In our
workshops, we sometimes had students brainstorm on paper as a warm-up activity,
but the proper beginning would always involve dissecting a story or film clip
and bouncing original ideas around in a group discussion.</p>

<p>This works great for elementary schoolers, whose boundless imaginations seldom
need more than a push-start. It’s insecurity about speaking in front of unknown
students (these were summer day camps, after all), not insecurity about their
creative facility, that holds them back.</p>

<p>High school students are another story, though. By tenth or eleventh grade, a
subset of kids now identifies as “ambitious.” They are eager to see their name
at the top of a page filled with text—especially if they can send it off as a
college or scholarship application—and they like the idea that they have a story
to tell. And they all <em>do.</em> But early on in our college essay workshop at BFI,
when asked to describe their apprehensions about writing their applications, all
also said some version of: “I have a vision for myself, but I’m not sure how
telling the story of my past adds up to it.”</p>

<p>The lead teacher on that workshop, a professional essay counselor who
volunteered to do this workshop for free, was excellent at helping students
connect their future ambitions with narratives of their past. Her process seemed
like a formula at first, until you looked closer and realized it was the exact
opposite. The students filled out surveys to get their superficial interests out
of the way—things like sports and music, or what Gude would call “‘symbols of
themselves’ [that] promote narrow, limited, socially pre-defined categories of
identity.” Having found this rhythm, the students next did a similar
questionnaire asking about their values and social concerns.</p>

<p>The task of the workshop (and, I suppose, the college essay broadly) was to use
storytelling to bridge column A with column B, and this central <em>how</em> question
of writing was left to the students’ creativity. There was, of course, the
obligatory read-over of successful application essays to top universities. But
this teacher didn’t ask the students to count the number of anecdotes, have them
calculate the ratio of “showing to telling,” or make any other such cruel
attempt to reduce writing to a mathematical exercise (as if words weren’t
intimidating enough <em>without</em> numbers). Instead, she led the students in a
discussion focusing on the emotional impact of specific phrases within each
essay. The students picked out the writerly gestures they found interesting;
there was no judgment if they favored a passage others deemed corny or wordy or
mathy. They were recognizing writing as a subjective undertaking. They were
seeing the faces in the inkblots.</p>

<p>As I prepare to be teaching music music again after a summer of creative
writing, I’m finding Gude’s article an impactful synthesis of this summer’s
implicit realizations. In arts education, we can do more than turn up the volume
on existing channels of students’ personas. Rather than asking that
stereotypical music-teacher question, “What kind of music are you into?” I think
we can arrive at a more innovative—and more stylistically robust—pedagogy by
asking students (and ourselves), “What kind of musician do you want to be?”
People, after all, are at art’s center.</p>

<p>By way of a soft ending: The next stop on this train of thought is
<a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/facing-the-music-9780195379761?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;">Huib Schippers’ <em>Facing the Music: Shaping Music Education from a Global Perspective</em></a>,
the core text for an elective I’m taking in our music education department. To
decenter western models of music teaching and learning, Schippers favors the
anthropological term <em>transmission</em> in describing how people encounter music.
“What we hear, learn, and teach is the product of what we believe about music,”
he writes. We believe music can inform a positive self-identity, an emotionally
attuned lifestyle, and the construction of stronger communities, but what
message do we send students when we spend forty minutes of a precious hour’s
general music class memorizing solfege syllables?</p>
