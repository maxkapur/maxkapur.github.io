            Driver’s ed should teach error recovery
          </a>
        </h2><p>I live near a one-way street, and drivers keep turning into it the wrong way by
mistake. Most react by getting flustered and backing dangerously into the
arterial, perhaps following an instinct to “undo” the error. The safer solution
(in my eyes) is to park the car, wait for traffic to clear, then use a driveway
to point yourself in the right direction.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, driver’s ed doesn’t teach you how to recover from mistakes like
this—at least, mine didn’t. Instead, driver’s ed teaches the rules of the
road and how to follow them. Once you have violated the law, even if by
accident, you are in undefined territory. Hence, drivers develop a strong
impulse to immediately “reverse” errors rather than identify a safe course of
action.</p>

            Sports idea

        </h2><p>A footrace, but the objective is to run as far as possible in a fixed amount of
time rather than speeding through a fixed distance. The catch is that the time
limit is drawn randomly at the start of the race, so you cannot strategize
around it being a sprint or distance event.</p>

<p>I think a good choice of distribution would be an log-normal distribution with a
mean of around four or five minutes and a fairly high variance. Perhaps we could
clamp the maximum time at eight hours, out of respect for the athletes’
work-life balance.</p>

<p>I ran (ha) this idea by a friend who is a competitive marathoner and he said,
“That sounds like hell.” This makes me think I am really onto something, because
many popular sports sound like hell to those who are not yet good at them.</p>

            New logo

<p><img src="/assets/images/logo-new.svg" alt="New logo: A stylized letter &quot;M&quot; formed by joining four segments with colors drawn from the site theme" /></p>

<p>The old one was just a square with my initials, MK, which seemed a little too
self-indulgent (not to mention that I share these initials with half of my
extended family, so I can hardly claim them as my own):</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/logo-old.svg" alt="Old logo: The initials MK in green on a yellowish background" /></p>

<p>The new logo still kind of forms a stylized letter <em>m,</em> if you imagine the three
theme-colored vertical segments as hanging from the horizontal segment on top.
It also <em>kind of</em> recalls the shape of the word <em>Ill,</em> which spells the start of
the blog title and doubles as a fun bit of retro slang.</p>

        <h2>
          <a class="post-link" href="/2024/05/03/best-thing-about-fish.html">
            The best thing about fish
          </a>
        </h2><p>The best thing about fish is probably the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_line">lateral line</a>,
which sort of like ears for underwater that enable fish to sense and locate
predators even in dark or murky conditions.</p>

<p>The best thing about the fish command-line <em>shell,</em> on the other hand, has to be
its “fuzzy” completions. In most other shells (like Microsoft PowerShell, which
I use every day at work), you can tab-complete a filename like
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blog_post_idea.md</code> by typing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blog</code> (the first part of the filename) and
pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd>. If there are multiple matches, you use the arrow keys
to scroll through them until you get the one you want.</p>

<p>This works fine if you put the most-unique part of your filenames at the
beginning. But I like to begin my filenames with
<a href="/2024/04/26/iso-dates-filenames.html">ISO dates</a>,
so to tab-complete <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2024-03-06_blog_post_idea.md</code> in PowerShell, I have to
type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2024</code> and then jab the arrow key a bunch of times, which is like using a
phone book that is sorted by phone number. In fish, I can just type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blogpost</code>
(even without the underscore) and it will autocomplete to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2024-03-06_blog_post_idea.md</code>.</p>

<p>Similar completions work for the options of most command-line programs, and it’s
(relatively) easy to extend the built-in completions with your own
<a href="https://fishshell.com/docs/current/completions.html">configuration files</a>
(but I’ve never needed to).</p>

            Why I put ISO dates in filenames
          </a>
        </h2><p>I am one of those obnoxious people who begins his filenames with an ISO date,
like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2024-03-06_blog_post_idea.md</code>. I know that file metadata already tracks
creation and revision dates, but I don’t like those: The creation date is
misleading when you duplicate a file to reuse its format or content, and the
revision date is all but meaningless because modern software modifies files on
disk in all kinds of spurious ways. I put an ISO date in my filenames
to assign them a <em>canonical</em> date. The canonical date means something like “the
last date at which this file underwent a significant change,” and I alone (not
software) can determine what that means.</p>
