          <a class="post-link" href="/2025/05/28/guitar-like-piano.html">
            Still playing guitar like piano
          </a>
        </h2><p>I still play the guitar like a piano. It’s most obvious when I try to play along
with the lead guitar part in a recording of a two-guitar band. Often, the lead
guitar just has a simple single-note riff or triads in the upper register, but I
cannot resist the impulse to insert bass notes in the “left hand” (often
grabbing them with my thumb). It doesn’t feel like a complete part without them.</p>

<p>Of course, there is already a bass in the recording, so playing in this way does
not add any value, and comes at the cost of less fluidity in the actual guitar
melody. I am trying to discpline myself to double lead guitar parts exactly, but
it’s hard to break the habit of embellishment.</p>

<p>Another way my piano training interferes with playing guitar is an instinctual
aversion to the capo. On the piano, if you want to play a song in a different
key, you <em>play it in a different key.</em> (Actually, a lot of keyboards have a
transposition feature, but using it is frowned upon.) But a guitar capo is
sometimes musically necessary access open chord voicings in flat keys.</p>

<p>My pianist problem is that when I play the guitar with a capo, I can never
decide whether to think in the transposed or concert key. The open chord
voicings certainly are easiest to remember in the transposed key, but as soon as
I need to play a melody higher on the neck, it’s like the capo isn’t there, and
I have to think in concert key to make any sense of it. Most often, I just get
really confused and put away the capo.</p>

        </h2><ul>
  <li><em>Honey, baby,</em> etc.</li>
  <li>Even young people have the accent. This surprised me because I thought that
regional accents were slowly melting away thanks to mass media. In Korea, kids
may have picked up a few regionalisms from family, but for the most part they
spoke like the video game streamers they watched on YouTube. In Tennessee, you
can hear an accent even in young toddlers.</li>
  <li>Frequency of conversations with strangers is somewhat higher than on the
coasts, but more noticeable is the length and depth of the conversations. I
spoke for five minutes with a guy in the elevator and we kept having to stick
our arms in the door to reopen it. We finally stopped talking when the
elevator starting beeping at us and forced the door closed. Didn’t even find
out his name.</li>
  <li>Haven’t heard any cool aphorisms like “it’s all grist for the mill” yet, but
my ears are open.</li>

            How I organize browser tabs
          </a>
        </h2><p>I didn’t realize I had a system for this until I did.</p>

<p>My system: I only ever open one browser window (OK, two on my work computer
where I use MS Edge profiles for different Microsoft accounts).</p>

<p>When I open a new tab, I scan the tabs already open and move it left or right so
that the tabs remain ordered by decreasing priority. “Priority” means something
like, how annoyed would I be if I closed this by accident?</p>

<ul>
  <li>High priority: Things that I keep open all day (email, GitHub issues).</li>
  <li>Medium priority: Documentation or reference material for the current task.</li>
  <li>Low priority: Random ephemera, landing pages from clicking a confirmation
email, article I already read but just need to copy a quote from, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whenever I start to have more than 15 or 20 tabs, I get a cramped feeling and
start axing tabs from right to left until I arrive at one that I still want
open. Usually, this leaves two or three tabs.</p>

<p>Sometimes I accidentally close things that I still needed, but I tell myself
that the time wasted reopening them is offset by the time saved searching
through dozens of tabs to find the right one.</p>

<p>Is this system any good?</p>

            Music videos
          </a>
        </h2><p>A side effect of my refusal to subscribe to Spotify (I just buy albums on
Bandcamp or used CDs) is that when someone sends me a song to listen to, I
usually look it up on YouTube and end up watching the music video. Because of
this, there are some songs or artists that I like more than I might have without
the video because the video adds an additional layer of interpretation.</p>

<p>I think I had mentally blocked myself from verbalizing this thought before
because of my background as a musician. I would like to think of myself as
someone who values the music itself and whose opinion of a song isn’t swayed by
the addition of a video track. After all, a music video is kind of like an
advertisement for the song or artist, a reference rather than the thing itself.</p>

<p>But then, I should have realized my susceptibility to music videos sooner,
because a big part of jazz school was learning how to <em>watch</em> jazz performances:
Musicians on stage employ a wide vocabulary of visual and bodily cues to steer
the ship while improvising.</p>

<p>And I went to a school whose music buildings were right next to the film
school—I think they actually had a small
<a href="https://musicbehindthescreen.blogspot.com/2013/03/scoring-stages-sony-mgm.html">scoring stage</a>
somewhere. Lots of my classmates did collaborations with film or animation
students, but I went the other way, preferring to incorporate “analog” art like
poetry and fiction into my music by setting texts to melodies. A missed
opportunity.</p>

            Reasons it’s hard to abandon a smartphone
          </a>
        </h2><p>Reasons (excuses?) that I cannot
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/01/opinion/how-quit-smartphone-addiction.html">downgrade to a dumbphone</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2FA apps. You can set up a generic TOTP program on your computer, but that’s
not very convenient, and some organizations explicitly require you to use
Microsoft or Google Authenticator. (I don’t know how they enforce this given
that the algorithm for generating TOTP codes from the secret is an open
standard.)</li>
  <li>My apartment building used to require an app to unlock the package room. The
app is proprietary and probably not secure. The only alternative to the app is
to bother the staff to open the package room for you.</li>
  <li>During the pandemic, Korea adopted a contact tracing system that involved
scanning a QR code in an app on your phone at every business you entered. Many
businesses would let you just write your phone number on a clipboard as an
alternative, but some (Starbucks) required the app. Was the app secure? Has
the database ever been breached? I sure hope not.</li>
  <li>Concert tickets from dice.fm. They have an exclusive deal with many venues
that makes them the only place you can buy tickets, and their system requires
you to store your tickets in their app, for anti-fraud reasons or whatever.
(At smaller venues, if you don’t have the app, they can manually verify your
name on the guest list.)</li>
</ul>

<p>I don’t like that a smartphone has become a de facto requirement participation
in society. Smartphones have only <em>existed</em> for a few years. The main purpose of
the “prove you own a (smart)phone” tests that most commercial and government
services put you through these days seems to be to combat spam: Acquiring and
maintaining a non-VOIP phone number that can receive SMS messages is too
expensive for most spammers to do at scale. But
<a href="/2025/03/04/check-prove-human.html">again</a>,
I resent that the burden of proof is on me to prove I’m not a spammer instead of
on the service to prove I am.</p>
