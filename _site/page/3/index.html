give better results than Google and friends. Indeed, the search results are a
little more relevant, especially when researching technical topics. I made great
use of the ability to
<a href="https://kagi.com/stats?stat=leaderboard">filter and promote entire domains</a>.
However, the pricing doesn’t work for me: $5/month gets you 300 searches, which
isn’t enough (I burned through the free 100 searches in a week), and for
unlimited searches, you have to pay $10 for a bundle deal that also includes AI
stuff I don’t care about. Kagi wants to become an everything app (probably
<a href="https://olly.pagecord.com/some-thoughts-on-kagi-search-after-two-months">adding email soon</a>),
which a tough sell while claiming to be a privacy-focused company. (Same issue
with Proton, by the way.)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.fender.com/pages/fender-studio">Fender Studio:</a> Fender, the guitar
company, just kind of threw this over the fence in May. It’s a free (but not
open source) digital audio workstation, so it competes with the likes of Ardour
and GarageBand. But Fender Studio runs on Linux, and quite well at that. On my
machine, it supports JACK with minimal configuration and achieves lower latency
than <a href="https://guitarix.org/">Guitarix</a> while doing a lot more. The vendored
backing tracks are a bit cheesy but well engineered.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/amperser/proselint">Proselint:</a> It’s a prose … linter, i.e.
you feed it your draft blog post and it complains about vague wording and common
typography problems like curly vs. straight quotes. I like that Proselint uses
regex instead of an LLM, so there’s no
<a href="/2025/06/18/thesaurus-cheating.html">creative interference</a>; it’s more
like an automated style guide than a chatty editor. But my homegrown
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">typography.py</code> script (I need to upload this to GitHub sometime) enforces a few
lesser irks, such as
<a href="https://editorsmanual.com/articles/number-ranges/">en dashes in numerical ranges</a>,
that Proselint lets be, so I’m still using both.</p>

            CLS advice nobody asked for
          </a>
        </h2><p>Awesome people occasionally reach out to ask me about the US State Department’s
<a href="https://clscholarship.org/">Critical Language Scholarship</a> (CLS) program.
I participated in CLS Korean in
2016, and I <em>still</em> find myself learning from the experiences I had in Gwangju
all those years ago (and that’s with four additional years of living in Korea
and several visits in between).</p>

<p>This year’s CLS cohort is getting started now or so, so I thought I would
write up a couple of tips for making the most of the program that I’ve
collected and shared over the years.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Contribute ideas for activities to do with your language partner, because
they may run out of them before long. Your outsider perspective might
generate interesting adventures like visiting a family with young kids or
sneaking into a college lecture.</li>
  <li>Embrace a Zen attitude with respect to the language policy. Understand that
some cohort members may need space to process new experiences and cultural
differences in English; this doesn’t mean they are not getting the most of
the program. Language acquisition doesn’t have to be your <em>only</em> goal.
(Context: CLS is famously an immersion-based program and requires
participants to sign a language pledge saying that they won’t use English for
the duration or the program. In retrospect, I was too much of a stickler
about it.)</li>
  <li>Identify and recognize your own stress responses and consider how they may
contribute to or ameliorate the stress experienced by others. This is
especially true for “elder” CLS participants (grad students and up), whom
younger participants tend to see as role models in adapting to unforeseen
challenges.</li>
  <li>Buy an umbrella in Korea and
<a href="https://www.cvs.com/shop/weather-station-folding-automatic-oversize-umbrella-assorted-colors-prodid-457782-reviews">thank me later</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>And please <a href="mailto:max@maxkapur.com">email me</a> if you are on CLS this
year and have any stories to share! I still have a
<a href="/2016/03/12/cls-korea.html">few posts</a> around
<a href="/2016/06/25/first-week-class-cnu.html">from my CLS days</a>, but nothing
profound.</p>

          <a class="post-link" href="/2025/06/18/thesaurus-cheating.html">
            Is using a thesaurus cheating?
          </a>
        </h2><p>I remember taking mild offense when my middle school language arts teacher
introduced our class to the thesaurus. I thought, if I let the thesaurus choose
my words for me, then is it even <em>my</em> writing anymore? This seems like a flaw in
my temperament: I always regard technology with suspicion when it threatens to
supplant human creativity.</p>

<p>Inevitably, as I progressed through high school and college, I made peace with
the thesaurus, and now I rely on it. A typical use case would be: “What’s that
word that means <em>deferential</em> but like, in an obnoxious way?” I plug the obvious
profanity into Merriam-Webster and it hands me back <em>obsequious.</em> I’ve trained
myself not to regard it as a creative failure if I accept this sort of help.
After all, it’s not like the thesaurus <em>tells</em> me which word to use; it just
brings it forth from the tip of my tongue.</p>

<p>OK, so this post had to be about generative AI, right? After a few years of
watching the world use and abuse large language models, I’m beginning to find
ways to accept an LLM’s assistance without feeling like I’ve outsourced my
creative process.
Mostly, I use LLM chat as a better search engine. For example, one of my first
questions was “Is there a NumPy built-in that does this?” with
a quick example. The machine pointed me immediately to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">numpy.unravel_index()</code>,
which was
<a href="https://numpy.org/doc/2.2/reference/generated/numpy.unravel_index.html">exactly</a>
what I needed. It would have taken me much longer to get to the same answer with
Google.</p>

<p>Sometimes, I have tried more involved discussions with the chatbot to improve my
understanding of a technical concept. In lengthy conversations, I try to put a
lot of thought into my questions. I ask the LLM to check my assumptions, issue
corrections, and supply keywords I can look up in an official reference—but
never to generate code, text, or ideas. (Sometimes it does that anyway, which I
find highly annoying.)</p>

<p>“We use tools to embody their virtues,” writes
<a href="https://borretti.me/article/you-can-choose-tools-that-make-you-happy">Fernando Borretti</a>.
I guess I value <a href="/2025/03/12/authenticity-ai-policy.html">authenticity</a>
or craftsmanship—my fingerprints on the finished product—more highly than laying
down as much code or text as I can in a fixed amount of time. This value
judgment (and it really is just that) precludes more aggressive uses of LLM tech
that, yes, might make me more productive in the short term. I’ll own that
tradeoff.
When it comes to new technology, we often speak of “early” and “late”
adopters—as though tech literacy means no more than finding the smooth part of a
hype wave. My goal is to adopt tools not on the basis of urgent marketing or the
fear of being left behind, but because I can use that tool to make myself
smarter.</p>

laptop and tried to bring it to parity with my main Kubuntu workstation in as

manual. I wanted to document the full process and see if I can find worthwhile

            Still playing guitar like piano
          </a>
        </h2><p>I still play the guitar like a piano. It’s most obvious when I try to play along
with the lead guitar part in a recording of a two-guitar band. Often, the lead
guitar just has a simple single-note riff or triads in the upper register, but I
cannot resist the impulse to insert bass notes in the “left hand” (often
grabbing them with my thumb). It doesn’t feel like a complete part without them.</p>

<p>Of course, there is already a bass in the recording, so playing in this way does
not add any value, and comes at the cost of less fluidity in the actual guitar
melody. I am trying to discpline myself to double lead guitar parts exactly, but
it’s hard to break the habit of embellishment.</p>

<p>Another way my piano training interferes with playing guitar is an instinctual
aversion to the capo. On the piano, if you want to play a song in a different
key, you <em>play it in a different key.</em> (Actually, a lot of keyboards have a
transposition feature, but using it is frowned upon.) But a guitar capo is
sometimes musically necessary access open chord voicings in flat keys.</p>

<p>My pianist problem is that when I play the guitar with a capo, I can never
decide whether to think in the transposed or concert key. The open chord
voicings certainly are easiest to remember in the transposed key, but as soon as
I need to play a melody higher on the neck, it’s like the capo isn’t there, and
I have to think in concert key to make any sense of it. Most often, I just get
really confused and put away the capo.</p>
