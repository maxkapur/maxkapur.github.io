            Media literacy chat at 88.9 Gwangju FM
          </a>
        </h2><p>I wanted to follow up on my <a href="/2024/11/02/gwangju-again.html">previous post</a> about the CLS alumni seminar in Gwangju to
spotlight my favorite excursion of the week: our visit to the <a href="https://kjfm.communityradio.kr/">88.9 Gwangju
FM</a> community radio station. Gwangju FM has
no particular theme, but they dedicate part of their schedule each week to
programming related to the Gwangju international community. When our group of
twenty-five showed up, the staff divided us into five groups and gave us two
hours each to produce a one-hour broadcast on a topic of our choice.</p>

<p>The task seemed impossible when the guide explained it to me (at work, we
routinely spend <em>weeks</em> choreographing what amounts to a brief slideshow
presentation), but the time pressure worked to our group’s advantage: all we
could really do was create a list of discussion questions and songs to provide
forward motion, then improvise from there. We ended up having a <a href="https://kjfm.communityradio.kr/broadcast/podcast/subPdcstList.do?pdcstId=PDCST_00000000003858&amp;pdcstCd=C&amp;orgnztId=OPRTN_01">spirited
discussion</a> about media literacy and news consumption. (Email me if the link breaks and I
will upload an MP3 instead.)</p>

<p>After our group disbanded in Gwangju, I got to spend a few days in Naju, my
“second hometown” where I taught English for two years as a Fulbright grantee. I
tried a new (to me) gomtang place called 나주곰탕사매기, which has a cool
aquarium, a garden, and even birds! A few pics below.</p>

            Gwangju again: CLS Media Literacy and Democracy seminar
          </a>
        </h2><p>I had the honor this week of participating in the first ever <a href="https://clscholarship.org/news/2024/cls-international-alumni-seminars">Critical Language
Scholarship Alumni Seminar</a>
(<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241015125209/https://clscholarship.org/news/2024/cls-international-alumni-seminars">archive.org mirror</a>)
at Chonnam National University in Gwangju, South Korea. The seminar focused on
media literacy and democracy, and I can’t think of a better time or place to
study the topic.</p>

<p>Koreans take their democracy very seriously, as evidenced by the high degree of
civic participation (there is virtually <em>always</em> a protest going on in front of
all the major government buildings in Seoul) and high voter turnout (77% in the
2022 presidential election). One reason is that Korea didn’t adopt a democratic
constitution until 1987, which puts Korea’s long struggle against authoritarian
rule well within living memory. The memory is especially fresh in Gwangju, the
site of the 5/18 (1980) independence movement, in which hundreds of activists
(many of them CNU students) lost their lives to state violence.</p>

<p>As we learned, throughout the 1980s, citizen journalists played a pivotal role
in resisting media censorship and spreading the true narrative of 5/18 via
informal publications; their contributions were arguably a key factor in the
eventual success of the 1987 democracy movement. I was encouraged to hear from a
panel of CNU student journalists about their efforts to document important
issues in the community and carry forward CNU’s tradition of advocacy through
journalism.</p>

<p>Our discussions during the seminar also reminded me of the important role that
art plays in shaping the collective narratives that energize and sustain a
democratic society. Today is another special moment in Gwangju’s history as the
city celebrates the author Han Kang’s receipt of the Nobel Prize in Literature.
Han Kang was born in Gwangju, and one of her novels, <em>Human Acts</em> (소년이 온다),
memorializes the 5/18 independence movement. I have to add this book to the
stack, as I have only read <em>The Vegetarian</em> (채식주의자), and only in
translation. Our group also viewed, at the <a href="https://artmuse.gwangju.go.kr/">Gwangju Museum of Art</a>, a pair of paintings by a then student
activist, now senior citizen who began in retirement to paint scenes from the
5/18 movement to preserve his memory and perspective. (Unfortunately, I can’t
find this artist’s name on the website.) Such images create a relationship
between the viewer and the events of 5/18 that rings “true” in a way that
journalistic accounts cannot.</p>

<p>As for me: Participating in this seminar meant that I got to return to the exact
institution where I did <a href="/2016/03/12/cls-korea.html">CLS in 2016</a>—my
first visit to Korea—with the added perspective of eight more years of Korean
study and four years of living in the country. It was a delight to show the
other participants around and see Korea again through the eyes of a newcomer.</p>

<p>During CLS in 2016, I was too shy to explore much of the city, but on this visit
the only limiting factor was time. After the seminar, I took a day to walk all
around the Asian Cultural Center, an endless arts complex. My highlight was
<em>Delivery Dancer’s Arc: Inverse,</em> a massive video installation from the studio
of science fiction creator Ayoung Kim (김아영). I also enjoyed the ACC’s library,
which has a slick reference area with art magazines and comfy chairs.</p>
