<a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/pb-max-kapur">had me as a guest on his People and Blogs series</a>
(<a href="/2025/02/14/people-and-blogs-local.html">local mirror</a>).
Welcome to anyone visiting this site via Manu’s feed! Take a look around and
<a href="mailto:max@maxkapur.com">let me know</a> what you think.</p>

<p>I was super excited to be interviewed by Manu, as many of his writings have
sharpened my thinking around why I prefer blogging, email, and group chats to
brand-name social media:</p>

<p>Manu has compiled a lot of useful information for people trying to pivot from
social media, such as his

are one of the friends I’ve been trying to talk into creating a personal site,

<a href="https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/14418#issuecomment-2513806325">Travis Hathaway</a>,
here is a shell one-liner to check if a Conda environment is up to date:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>conda update <span class="nt">--all</span> <span class="nt">--dry-run</span> <span class="nt">--json</span> | jq <span class="nt">-e</span> <span class="s1">'.success and (.actions | length) == 0'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It exits (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-e</code>) with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code> if the environment is already updated and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code> if
updates are available.</p>

<p>I use this in CI so that I get an email if my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">environment.yml</code> file is holding
any packages back.</p>

<p>Because this command actually executes the dependency solver, it won’t report
the environment as out of date unless a package both has an available update
<em>and</em> can be updated while satisfying all the other dependencies’ version
constraints.</p>

            Newly excavated posts about teaching
          </a>
        </h2><p>When I migrated from Blogger to Jekyll a few years ago, I left a bunch of posts
behind, with the vague resolution of importing them at some point. Today, I
excavated a few more from the archives, all about teaching:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/2020/05/06/nonnative-teacher.html">The benefits of a
nonnative teacher</a> (2020): A very long-winded way of saying that language
learners often benefit from having a teacher who <em>isn’t</em> a native speaker of
the target language, because then the teacher has empathy for the student. I
think I stand by this take.</li>
  <li><a href="/2018/08/25/a-thing-here.html">Things that are a thing
here</a> (2018): Just a few days into my Fulbright job, I was enamored with
how seriously Korean teachers took their profession—and still am. But knowing
what I do now, I would not write “Art, music, literature, and ‘morality’ class
matter [in Korean schools] just as much as the STEM subjects.” Of course, all
these subjects factor into your GPA, but as in the US, many Korean teachers
and parents believe that the best jobs go to STEM graduates. And thus, even if
it’s not their intention, they tend to celebrate students’ success in those
subjects with a bit of extra energy.</li>
  <li><a href="/2017/08/31/students-as-creators.html">Centering students as
creators</a> (2017): Notes from my undergrad internship. I think I see the
germ here of an idea I’ve grown more certain of since: When you don’t know how
to proceed, the first thing you should do is <em>start.</em> You know—open a
document, put your name and the date, choose a font. These first steps shake
off the fear of failure and assure the brain that it is safe to proceed.</li>

            Two novels to understand Korea’s political turmoil
          </a>
        </h2><p>On Tuesday night, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol imposed martial law
across the country for six hours. He retracted his declaration only after the
National Assembly passed an emergency resolution ordering him to back down. As
of this writing, the Assembly has drafted but failed to vote on articles of
impeachment. Instead, Yoon’s party has announced a plan for the president’s
<a href="https://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20241208050033">“orderly resignation.”</a>
Many details remain up in the air.</p>

<p>As an American, it is not my place to take sides or say what Korea should do
next; I can only observe and interpret. With that as my goal, I would like to
discuss two novels that may supply context to the current political situation.</p>

<p>First, to understand the images that Koreans associate with “martial law,” we
must discuss Han Kang’s 2014 novel <em>Human Acts</em> (한강, «소년이 온다»), which is
available in an English translation by Deborah Smith. The novel portrays 1980’s
5/18 movement and the ensuing government crackdown in which public officials
killed, sexually assaulted, arrested, and tortured pro-democracy activists in
Gwangju on false charges of communist sympathy—crimes that the Korean government
has since acknowledged.<sup id="fnref:ack"><a href="#fn:ack" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> As Friday’s <em>New York Times</em> explains
(<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/world/asia/gwangju-massacre-human-acts-han-kang.html">paywall</a>),
Han Kang’s recent Nobel Prize offered a moment of catharsis and vindication for
victims of the 1980 incident; the recent turmoil has cut short their
celebration.</p>

<p>Next is <em>28</em> by Jeong You Jeong (정유정). Set in Hwayang, a fictional city on the
outskirts of Seoul, this 2013 novel imagines the outbreak of a highly infectious
disease transmitted between humans and dogs. Once the Korean government grasps
the infection’s contagiousness and lethality, the president imposes a swift
military blockade on the city. Within, anarchy prevails. As the citizens of
Hwayang clash with the occupying troops, <em>28</em> makes transparent reference to the
crimes of 5/18, but pushes further to ask how martial law would unfold with
modern technology and social media. Jeong also raises difficult questions about
the transactional relationship between humans and animals. (And, because it is a
Jeong You Jeong novel, there is a serial killer running around.) It looks like
Chi-Young Kim translated this novel into English at the Literature Translation
Institute of Korea, but all I can find is an
<a href="https://www.kln.or.kr/lines/fictionView.do?bbsIdx=358">excerpt</a>.</p>

<p>These modern novels remind us that in Korea, the concept of authoritarian rule
is more than a rhetorical foil, but a living memory than looms over public
policy and civic life. At this moment, martial law is no longer in effect,
President Yoon has apologized, and the democratically elected National Assembly
controls the government. That means that Korea’s future is, for now, safely in
the hands of its people.</p>
