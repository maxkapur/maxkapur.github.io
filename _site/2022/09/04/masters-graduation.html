    <p>On September 29, I received my master’s degree in industrial engineering from Seoul National University!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/ms-graduation.jpg" alt="A photograph of Max wearing his cap and gown at Seoul National University." /></p>

<p>It’s been a wonderful two years. Despite the challenges of social distancing, I was able to take a diverse assortment of courses in optimization, economics, and human factors; participate in research projects in two different labs; present at a conference in Jeju; and write (in both Korean and English) a thesis I’m <a href="https://github.com/maxkapur/CollegeApplication">rather proud of</a>.<!--more--></p>

<p>As part of my duties in the Management Science/Optimization Lab, I had the opportunity to serve as the course TA for two of my advisor’s optimization courses, both of which have now been published as free online courses:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://etl.snu.ac.kr/courses/630f4b716b3fac204b3e4a98">선형 및 비선형 최적화 (Linear and Nonlinear Optimization)</a> is an upper-division undergraduate course on linear programming and convex optimization.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-optimization">Introduction to Optimization</a> is an edX course targeted at undergraduates and working professionals, which we created with the support of a grant from SNU’s center for teaching and learning.</li>
</ul>

<p>Developing the edX course was especially fun: edX has an <a href="https://openedx.org/community/documentation/">open platform</a> for online courses that lets you create an interactive classroom with videos, captions, automatically graded exercises, and plenty more. Setting up the student activities with automatic grading in a way that is both user-friendly and rigorous was a neat challenge. I hope these courses can bring the theoretically grounded, practically oriented education that I received at SNU to a wider audience of optimization students.</p>
