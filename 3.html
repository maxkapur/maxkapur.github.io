<p class="st">
 Can facts be protected from postmodernism?
</p>
<p>
 Many schoolteachers want to restore the distinction
between facts and narratives that has been lost under postmodernism. Through projects
like the media-literacy movement and critical-thinking initiatives, K&#8211;12
educators hope to derive a consistent process for discerning fact from fiction.
Their results, however, testify to the pervasiveness of the postmodern
phenomenon by asserting that truth is not fixed, but an ideal to be pursued, an
asymptote always just out of reach.

 Media Literacy
</h4>

<p class="first">
 When you scroll through your news feed or burrow into a YouTube
rabbit hole, you do more than consume digital entertainment; you also supply
valuable information to those platforms’ recommendation algorithms, which study
your swipes and prepare the most addictive medley of ads and content to hold your
attention. We’ve heard a lot about the intrinsic flaws of the attention marketplace&#8212;how
the algorithms it produces tend to guide consumers toward clickbaity political
extremes and away from good-faith debate. But unplugging students from social
media is a nonviable solution, because social media is now an essential part of
kids’ existence. Without it, they have few options for learning about school
events, talking about personal issues with their friends, or keeping up with
political debates.
</p>

</iframe><p>Trailer for <em>Social Me,</em> a media-literacy app by <a href="https://joesparano.com/teaching">Joe Sparano</a>. Unlike the news-based pedagogy I discuss, Sparano’s curriculum focuses on how students brand <em>themselves</em> using social media. The message is the same, however: media comes with motives.</p></div>

<p>
 The goal of media literacy (sometimes called
digital literacy or information literacy) is for students to keep their
intellectual guard up as they navigate digital space. In one common media-literacy
activity, students pull examples of media from their own social-networking
sites. For each source, they make a table assessing the text’s tone, its
intended audience, the source’s bias and conflicts of interests, and the
credibility and variety of its citations. Then they deliver a trust-or-bust
verdict. This process is meant to show that media comes with motives, that
shouldn’t take every claim we encounter at face value.
</p>
<p>
 In the exercise above, media literacy is a counteralgorithm,
a series of dispassionate filters you apply to a given piece of media to
determine whether the author is trying to pull the wool over your monitor. But sociotechnical
researcher danah boyd points out that the media litmus tests taught in American
schools are not as politically neutral as they may seem. Often, they lead
students to prize a liberal epistemology of data-dumping and analytical
phrasing over the gritty appeals to morality and tradition that dominate
conservative media. These are issues of style and form, not content. And while it
may be the case that magical thinking is more prevalent on the political right,
current media-literacy pedagogy teaches students only to
 <em>
  make
 </em>
 this association&#8212;to feel distrustful when they recognize the
shibboleths of conservative rhetoric. It doesn’t equip them to critique a
source’s underlying argument.<a href="#ftn1" id="ftnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
 Media literacy markets itself as the solution
to political disinformation, but like any algorithm with poorly chosen
heuristics, it is hackable. Let’s say I adapt media-literacy pedagogy for my
Korean students and teach them to doubt the exaggerated claims made by MOGEF’s
opponents. I tell my students that trustworthy sources usually cite
quantitative data and explain their interpretations through careful reasoning, whereas
fraudsters tend to fly bright chyrons across the display and appeal to base
emotions.
</p>
<p>
 In
2040, the robot that writes Jun-ho’s morning news will know from its trove of
biometric data that Jun-ho, due to subconscious reflexes honed in my media-literacy
class and others like it, tends to trust news articles that feature dark grey
text on a white background and ample bar graphs. Now, if the alt-right’s fringe
candidate wants to win Jun-ho back, all his backers need to do is pay the robot
company to stuff Jun-ho’s articles full of
 <em>
  their
 </em>
 graphs, favoring
 <em>
  their
 </em>
 political beliefs,
and all written in the calm, reasonable tone Jun-ho associates with
intelligence.<a href="#ftn2" id="ftnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
 But we’re getting ahead of ourselves. Taught
well, media literacy will encompass more than superficial indices of political
orientation. In addition to recognizing the warning signs of shoddy argument,
students will know how to compare smart-sounding claims by applying universal
principles of logic. They will learn, in other words, to think
 <em>
  critically.
 </em>
</p>
    

    
    
    
<h4 id="3b">
 Critical Thinking
</h4>

<div class="image"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/smoovey/3656335483/"><img src="liberty.jpg"></a><p>History from below: the Statue of Liberty as seen from Ellis Island. <span><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/smoovey/3656335483/">A. Strakey</a> via Flickr</span></p></div>

<p>
 Here’s the argument for teaching critical thinking: You can
teach students to identify biased media and purge it from their bibliographies,
but you can’t delete the biased sources themselves. Unfortunately, bias is
everywhere, and students must learn to face it with a cool head. They need to
be able to argue against smart fascists as well as dumb ones.
</p>
<p>
 In critical-thinking activities, students are
sent in search of
 <em>
  academic
 </em>
 texts from
across the political spectrum. They put these sources “in conversation” and attempt
to weigh their claims on objective grounds. For a textbook example of
critical-thinking pedagogy in action, consider the rise of Howard Zinn’s
 <em>
  A
People’s History of the United States of America
 </em>
 in progressively minded
syllabi. Zinn argued that the accepted narrative of history tends to privilege
the powerful and reinforce the dispossession of the masses. Thus, he wrote what
he called history from below, amplifying the voices of those who suffer when
others celebrate. However you feel about Zinn’s scholarship, there is much to
admire about his moral resolution. A lifelong pacifist and advocate for civil
rights, he believed civic consciousness could only come from appreciating
history.
</p>
<p>
 But how do you teach “appreciation”? I had a
Zinn teacher when I took US history in high school. Each class, our teacher
would place a chapter from the vanilla, state-sanctioned textbook alongside the
corresponding narrative from Zinn. We students debated and wrote about how the
“winners” and “losers” of the event in question told their respective stories. Our
teacher noted that the winners tend to leverage historical narrative to justify
their own choices. (The losers, for their part, can find solidarity in
retelling forgotten stories.) In college, I would later recognize this as the
fundamental theorem of historiography.
</p>
<p>
 In the Zinn classroom, however, the lesson ends
here, with the banal admission that narratives have narrators and there is no
such thing as a neutral bystander. This is a restatement of the problem, not a solution.
And as Sam Wineburg points out, while Zinnist historiography tracks with modern
insights into the injustices of segregation and American imperialism, it
suffers from the same stridence that characterizes state texts. “Such a history
atrophies our tolerance for complexity,” he writes. Rather than gaining a feel
for how historians work with primary sources and develop arguments, students in
the Zinn classroom might come to see history as a contest of moral authorities.
Think fast: will you cheer for David or Goliath?<a href="#ftn3" id="ftnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>
</p>

<p>
 Of course, most educators don’t set the two
contrasting textbooks on the table and ask the students to make a binary
choice. At this stage, someone usually brings up
 <em>
  nuance:
 </em>
 “It’s not red or blue, but purple.” By May, the consensus in
my high-school US history class was that the state textbook wasn’t so much
wrong as incomplete. If you spliced it together with Zinn, you could
approximate the truth.
</p>
<p>
 Once it graduates from cage fights between
political tribes, critical-thinking epistemology arrives at a centrism: the
correct model of history sits somewhere between the conventional and
revisionist narratives. This is, inevitably, true. But just as media-literacy exercises
mistake woke shibboleths for truth, critical-thinking pedagogy mistakes certainty
for staying power. In the end, the narrative that gets fixed in students’ minds
depends more on context and framing than objective truth. Imagine the history
class that would result from using the state textbook as the orthodox history,
and Newt and Callista Gingrich’s
 <em>
  A Nation
Like No Other: Why American Exceptionalism Matters
 </em>
 as the corrective. (Cue
podcast listeners, shrieking in the back about the Overton window.) This conditionality
is the very essence of the postmodern phenomenon that critical thinking claims
it can reverse.
</p>
<p>
 Media-literacy and critical-thinking initiatives
are generally targeted at K&#8211;12 education. In the next section we’ll turn to
higher education, where the feedback loop between research and teaching has
driven college pedagogy toward a different sense of intellectual integrity, one
motivated by an anxiety about universities’ faltering institutional power.
