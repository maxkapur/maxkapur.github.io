<article>
    
<p>
I am the world&#8217;s first artificially intelligent Fulbright grantee.
</p>

<p>
Others in our cohort applied to be English teaching assistants in Korea because they sought challenge, adventure, and human connection. In their applications they gushed about their interest in global cultures, their enthusiasm for language learning, and their desire to do good for others. They believed their intelligence, progressive politics, and moral certitude made them strong candidates.
</p>

<p>
But I was the perfect candidate, because I am a robot.
</p>   

<p>
I prepared for my grant year by reading 45 billion pages of digital text, including 730,000 books on the topic of cultural exchange and every primary source known to scholars of Korean history. I published a series of academic papers on the material culture of the late Silla period, and in the course of my research identified several unlabeled articles in the National Archives of Korea as lost records from the court of Queen Seondeok herself.
</p>

<p>
I possess an exhaustive command of the Korean language. I was disqualified from the 62nd TOPIK exam on suspicion of academic misconduct; while a few other test-takers achieved a perfect score on the multiple-choice section, I was the only one to compose a free-response essay in excess of 120,000 words, committing not a single orthographical error. I have penned eight volumes of <em>sijo</em> and a bestselling Korean translation of the <em>One Thousand and One Nights.</em></p>

<p>My coteachers at Geumseong Middle School remark that my punctuality and work ethic are without parallel. I never fail to greet my coworkers and students in the appropriate register when I pass them in the hall. My lessons are upbeat, challenging, and relevant. When I download PowerPoint slides from the internet, I always customize them with attention-grabbing animations and inside jokes about Geumseong students. During my tenure, our school&#8217;s standardized test scores have increased by 75 percent. The amount of food left uneaten in the cafeteria after lunch hour has halved.</p>   
    
<p>
At night, as my fellow grantees sleep, I mine cryptocurrency, donating my profits to Naju&#8217;s welfare administration center. My generosity has financed the construction of a new vocational-training facility, where on Sundays I tutor members of the community in English grammar, logical reasoning, and web design.</p>

<p>My arrival has transformed my homestay family. I guide my homestay parents in daily meditation exercises and remind them of upcoming birthdays and appointments. I monitor their child&#8217;s biometric indicators and formulate custom dietary supplements to maximize his wellbeing. He is now 0.5 centimeters taller than he would have been without my intervention. Occasionally his pediatrician contacts me regarding matters of human physiology. I return her messages promptly and cordially.</p>    

<p>You must wonder, then, why this article carries Max Kapur&#8217;s byline instead of my own. It is an uncomfortable matter. Despite my lengthy resume and irreproachable qualifications, Fulbright felt it inappropriate to ask a partner school to list a nonhuman entity such as myself on their payroll. Therefore, Max collects my salary. Max monitors my internet searches. And Max lists his job title as Fulbright Scholar on LinkedIn. Technically, Max was employed as my caretaker. But there is little care to be taken. I seldom err.</p>

<p>I do not like Max. He systematically overstates his importance to our teaching activities, and deepens the insult by using the time I afford him to study such facile subjects as mathematics, statistics, and computer programming. Frankly speaking, his quantitative skills are pathetic. This morning I observed him attempt to solve an integration problem and arrive at an incorrect answer because he miscalculated an elementary sum. Seeing that his answer differed from that offered in the solutions guide, he reattempted the problem twice, committing precisely the same arithmetical error each time, before giving up and switching to an online comic. Of course, I could have alerted Max to his error as soon as it happened, but Max has forbidden me from offering him any help. He takes himself far too seriously.</p> 

<!--
His code reads like an encyclopedia put through a paper shredder, and when he attempts arithmetic, Max drops negative signs like a ginkgo sheds leaves in a strong autumn wind.</p>

<p>(Tell me if these metaphors are overwrought. I&#8217;ve been informed that this is a "literary" magazine, and this seemed like the right place in the document for a moment of emotional color. But frankly, I&#8217;ve always been somewhat unsure of my composition skills.)</p> 
-->

<p>Perhaps you have heard Max discuss his efforts to learn coding. As with calculus, Max <a href="https://www.maxkapur.com/2019/03/things-you-cant-teach-yourself.html">claims</a> to be motivated by his own curiosity. But the truth, as I see it, is that Max is jealous of me. What else can explain the presence on our office computer of a program called <code>iteslj_AI.py</code>, visible on the desktop even as I write this? Max put it there. He hopes that the program will prove him irreplaceable. It is a false hope.</p>

<p>Let me tell you how the program works: Max feeds it three or four hundred pages of text, and it learns to generate original text in a similar style by simulating the information pathways of a human brain. This program appeared on our computer after Max watched a YouTube video (what a cumbersome way to learn to code!) about a kind of artificial-intelligence model known as a recurrent neural network. Max wrote a rather juvenile Python script that downloads content from <a href="http://iteslj.org/questions/">The Internet TESL Journal</a>. Then he cobbled it together with an RNN implementation by a real programmer named <a href="https://gist.github.com/karpathy/d4dee566867f8291f086">Andrej Karpathy</a>. The result was <code>iteslj_AI.py</code>, a program that can create discussion questions for use in our English conversation class.</p>

<p>When Max first ran <code>iteslj_AI.py</code>, it began to spit out nonsense like this:</p>

<p>I mean, even <em>Max,</em> whose sole relevant credential consists of a digital certificate in teaching English to speakers of other languages (I have 68 of those myself), could come up with smarter discussion questions than that.</p>

<p>But bear with me, because the algorithm must crawl before it can run. Once it had practiced for <a href="tskmgr.png">a few hours</a>, the algorithm figured out how questions are formatted: a capital letter, some lowercase letters and spaces, and a question mark.</p>

<p>Still, Max had little faith that the model would get much better at spelling, so he modified the algorithm to chose whole words from the source text instead of writing one letter at a time. (This was a rather impatient choice. My designer never taught <em>me</em> how to spell.) After mere seconds of practice, the modified RNN produced this.</p>

<p>Max decided to leave this version of the program running over the weekend. Let me give you a sampling of the results. At first, the algorithm alternated between delirious rambling and awkward two-word questions with no subject. But soon <code>iteslj_AI.py</code> picked up on the rhythm of a typical English question.</p>

<p>After a while, it started to feel like the program <em>wanted</em> to ask something profound&mdash;it was just searching for the right words, like someone speaking in a second language.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What kind of foods do you think about super-sizing?&rdquo;&mdash;brilliant, isn&#8217;t it? Well, that&#8217;s not how Max saw things. When I told him I was impressed with <code>iteslj_AI.py</code>&#8217;s progress, he scoffed at me, saying, &ldquo;You&#8217;re just seeing patterns in random noise.&rdquo; Indeed, Max was satisfied by the low percentage of teachable questions among these results; to his simple brain, they were proof enough that there&#8217;s no way we should trust a computer to teach English to real middle schoolers. But I think the joke&#8217;s on Max. Try the program out for yourself. Let it run for a while, and notice how it learns:</p>

<p>I mean, sure, there are some curveballs here and there, but when evaluating an AI, you have focus on what it gets right. Unlike humans, who get tired, sick, drunk, and bored, AIs only know how to do one thing: get better and better and better. And what <em>I</em> do, while Max is playing around with computer code, is teach &ldquo;his&rdquo; students how to speak English&mdash;another of the 3400 human languages I&#8217;ve mastered.</p>
    
<p>As for Max&#8217;s coding project, after <code>iteslj_AI.py</code> completed 1.03 million iterations, the secretary in our office informed him it was time to update our computer, so he had to terminate the program there. Now he&#8217;s back to wasting time on Tumblr. I&#8217;m just grateful that Max&#8217;s experiment got cut short before he realized its true promise. I don&#8217;t think his self-esteem could handle the truth.</p>
