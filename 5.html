 The Limits of Narrative Fluency
</h2>
<p class="st">
 Does narrative fluency solve the problems it sets out to?
</p>
<p>
 The pedagogical currents described above aim for what I’ve
been calling narrative fluency: the receptive ability to tease arguments apart and
examine their evidential bases, plus the productive ability to weave together original
arguments using facts (or “facts”) and language. Far be it from me to deny the
value of skills like historical thinking and web design. If I were advising a
high-school civics teacher or history department chair today, and if they
assured me that my ideals wouldn’t be drowned under the practical challenges of
teaching, I would likely tell them to draw from many of the pedagogical streams
I’ve discussed. For all their limitations, creative pedagogies involving contemporary
problems and real media handily beat traditional facts-only teaching. Nonetheless,
let me voice two broad concerns about narrative fluency.
</p>
<p>
 The first is that serial exercises in critical thinking
can engender a kind of epistemological complacency. After the professors
publish their op-eds, after the students grade them on the media-literacy
rubric, after MOGEF passes the most rigorous vetting&#8212;even in the face of all
this evidence, Jun-ho’s mind may remain unchanged. And if someone should then challenge
his beliefs, Jun-ho can now say, “I’ve looked at all the facts and studies.
Have you? No? Then clearly <em>I’m</em> not
the one who needs to give things a second thought.” Narrative fluency wants to
be a process for overturning our long-held assumptions, but it can just as
easily become an excuse for stubbornness.
</p>
<p>
 At the heart of the critical-thinking discourse
lies a spiritual belief that if we only think hard enough, we will arrive at
objective truth. But how do we know when we’ve thought hard enough? The only
way we can be sure that narrative-fluency pedagogy is working is when it guides
people to the conclusions we have already decided they ought to reach. Those
who maintain fringe views despite the teacher’s best efforts force us to
backtrack and ask what went wrong. Perhaps we didn’t engage with the
counterargument thoroughly. Perhaps the sources lacked diversity. Perhaps Jun-ho
just isn’t
 <em>
  getting
 </em>
 it. In any case,
narrative fluency gets to measure its own yardstick.
</p>
<p>
 My greatest concern about narrative fluency,
then, has to do with trust. Mastering the language of science helped a
generation of quacks trot out eugenic fantasies. Narrative is power: narrative
is morally fraught.
</p>
<p>
 Pretend, for a moment, that we perfect narrative-fluency
pedagogy. We’ve figured out how to teach every student to distinguish fact from
fake, analyze arguments critically, and write (or record, or code, or perform)
persuasive narratives of their own. Of course, only a subset of these students will
enter professional fields that grant them a public platform. And only an
idealistic subset of these will accept a life of financial insecurity to become
journalists, teachers, or university researchers whose ostensible goal is to tell
the correct story. The majority&#8212;and the most talented&#8212;of the narratively fluent
will work at PR firms, undertake research in private industry, or serve as in-house
legal counsel for multinational corporations. For narrative skill is highly
fungible.
</p>
<p>
 For a glimpse of a future in which narrative
fluency has been thoroughly commodified, consider the media-literacy program at
the Ross School, an exclusive prep school in Long Island. For $41,200 in yearly
tuition, they get to learn about the “construction and deconstruction of
media,” spar with bright young minds, and gain entry into the tightest social
circles of tomorrow’s big media. Ross’s curriculum, and education journalist
Alexandria Neason’s glowing review of it, demonstrates a familiar pattern in
pedagogical change: elite private schools set the pace, and the rest of the
education system plays catchup. Ross students are taking the best
media-literacy courses from the best teachers before everyone else. They will
retain a competitive advantage in the workforce for years to come.<a href="#ftn7" id="ftnref7"><sup>7</sup>

</p>
<p>
 The pedagogy of narrative fluency upholds
itself as an antidote to moral bankruptcy, but at best, it is morally neutral. While
narrative intelligence may guide some to the right answers, for many students,
it will become a marketable aptitude alongside the familiar twenty-first century
skills of computer coding, tax minimization, and personal branding. (Indeed,
these skills themselves rely on a command of narrative.) Educators teach their
students about argument in school under the assumption that it will make them
more objective, conscientious citizens. But once these students graduate, they
find that the incentives are broken. There’s far more money in manipulating the
masses on behalf of the powerful.
</p>
<p>
 Good luck outsmarting them.
